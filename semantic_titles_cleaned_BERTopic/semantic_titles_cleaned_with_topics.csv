Integrated Planning in Hospitals: A Review,"Sebastian Rachuba, Melanie Reuter-Oppermann, Clemens Thielen","Efficient planning of scarce resources in hospitals is a challenging task for which a large variety of Operations Research and Management Science approaches have been developed since the 1950s. While efficient planning of single resources such as operating rooms, beds, or specific types of staff can already lead to enormous efficiency gains, integrated planning of several resources has been shown to hold even greater potential, and a large number of integrated planning approaches have been presented in the literature over the past decades. This paper provides the first literature review that focuses specifically on the Operations Research and Management Science literature related to integrated planning of different resources in hospitals. We collect the relevant literature and analyze it regarding different aspects such as uncertainty modeling and the use of real-life data. Several cross comparisons reveal interesting insights concerning, e.g., relations between the modeling and solution methods used and the practical implementation of the approaches developed. Moreover, we provide a high-level taxonomy for classifying different resource-focused integration approaches and point out gaps in the literature as well as promising directions for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a1c2b1be9e8b81f77872d9dc11dc91cf3054320,6a1c2b1be9e8b81f77872d9dc11dc91cf3054320,integrated planning hospital review,"Sebastian Rachuba, Melanie Reuter, Clemens Thielen",efficient planning scarce resource hospital challenging task large variety operation research management science approach developed since 1950s efficient planning single resource operating room bed specific type staff already lead enormous efficiency gain integrated planning several resource shown hold even greater potential large number integrated planning approach presented literature past decade paper provides first literature review focus specifically operation research management science literature related integrated planning different resource hospital collect relevant literature analyze regarding different aspect uncertainty modeling use real-life data several cross comparison reveal interesting insight concerning e.g. relation modeling solution method used practical implementation approach developed moreover provide high-level taxonomy classifying different resource-focused integration approach point gap literature well promising direction future research,integrated planning hospital review efficient planning scarce resource hospital challenging task large variety operation research management science approach developed since 1950s efficient planning single resource operating room bed specific type staff already lead enormous efficiency gain integrated planning several resource shown hold even greater potential large number integrated planning approach presented literature past decade paper provides first literature review focus specifically operation research management science literature related integrated planning different resource hospital collect relevant literature analyze regarding different aspect uncertainty modeling use real-life data several cross comparison reveal interesting insight concerning e.g. relation modeling solution method used practical implementation approach developed moreover provide high-level taxonomy classifying different resource-focused integration approach point gap literature well promising direction future research,3,3_power_system_planning_voltage

Energy Storage System Analysis Review for Optimal Unit Commitment,"H. Howlader, O. Adewuyi, Yingyi Hong, P. Mandal, Ashraf Mohamed Hemeida, T. Senjyu","Energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential to ensure continuity of energy supply and maintain the reliability of modern power systems. Intermittency and uncertainty of renewable generations due to fluctuating weather conditions as well as uncertain behavior of load demand make ESSs an integral part of power system flexibility management. Typically, the load demand profile can be categorized into peak and off-peak periods, and adding power from renewable generations makes the load-generation dynamics more complicated. Therefore, the thermal generation (TG) units need to be turned on and off more frequently to meet the system load demand. In view of this, several research efforts have been directed towards analyzing the benefits of ESSs in solving optimal unit commitment (UC) problems, minimizing operating costs, and maximizing profits while ensuring supply reliability. In this paper, some recent research works and relevant UC models incorporating ESSs towards solving the abovementioned power system operational issues are reviewed and summarized to give prospective researchers a clear concept and tip-off on finding efficient solutions for future power system flexibility management. Conclusively, an example problem is simulated for the visualization of the formulation of UC problems with ESSs and solutions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0defa0ac15e5de1890dc81d5d389c3c9e4aba2a,d0defa0ac15e5de1890dc81d5d389c3c9e4aba2a,energy storage system analysis review optimal unit commitment,"H.

Risk culture and employee performance for optimal organizational success: the mediating role of employee satisfaction and employee engagement,"Abdur Rahim, Md Harun Or Rosid, Najmul Hasan","
Purpose
This paper aims to investigate the impact of risk culture on employee performance by exploring the mediating roles of employee satisfaction and employee engagement in the relationship between risk culture and employee performance.


Design/methodology/approach
The study employed partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess both the direct effects and mediation effects, using a sample of 311 employees from the banking and insurance sectors. In contrast to PLS-SEM, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) technique was also applied to discern the causal configurations that lead to improved employee performance.


Findings
The findings revealed a significant direct effect of risk culture on employee performance, employee satisfaction and employee engagement. The findings also revealed that employee satisfaction significantly mediated the relationship between risk culture and employee performance, whereas the mediating role of employee engagement is partially significant. The fsQCA findings illustrated that a diverse combination of risk culture dimensions, employee satisfaction and employee engagement can result in enhanced employee performance.


Practical implications
This study provides important implications for the banking and insurance industries, suggesting that organizations should prioritize the development of a strong risk culture to improve employee-related outcomes such as performance, satisfaction and engagement, which are key factors for achieving optimal organizational success.


Originality/value
The paper specifically highlights the importance of integrating risk culture into human resource management, providing valuable insights for organizations seeking to enhance their risk management practices and culture.

Digital Health and Self-Management in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies: A Missed Opportunity?,"S. Battista, Benedetto Giardulli, C. Sieiro Santos, O. Aharonov, Darshan Puttaswamy, Anne-Marie Russell, Latika Gupta","Purpose of Review This paper explored the potential of digital health in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), with a focus on self-management. Digital self-management technology includes tailored treatment plans, symptom tracking, educational resources, enhanced communication, and support for long-term planning. Recent Findings After arguing the importance of digital health in IIMs management, from diagnosis until treatment, our literature review revealed a notable gap in research focusing on the efficacy of digital self-management interventions for individuals with IIMs, with no randomised controlled trials or observational studies addressing this topic. Summary Our review further highlighted the significant unmet need for research in self-management interventions for individuals with IIMs. The absence of studies underscores the necessity for collaborative efforts to address this gap and develop personalised, effective strategies for managing IIMs using digital technology. Individuals with IIMs deserve tailored self-management approaches akin to those available for other rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.

A Systematic Review on Bilingualism and Language Processing from 2015-2019,"Or-Kan Soh, H. Azman, S. Ho","Over the past few decades, research on bilingualism has been extensively covered but still leaves room for much to be discovered especially in the context of language processing. There is a lack in systematic review on studies that examine the trends, effects, methodological approaches, challenges and limitations on bilingualism in relation to language processing. Therefore, this article aims to offer current understanding on bilingualism and language processing through a process of a critical analysis and synthesis. A total of 20 articles published from 2015-2019 in peer-reviewed journals both abroad and locally were selected to be included in this review for content analysis. Hence, this paper attempts to give a systematic report on the findings categorized by trends, effects, methodological approaches, challenges and limitations. Few main findings emerged: (a) An increasing trend in the study on internal language processing and individual factors affecting bilingualism; (b) The existence of inconsistent effects; (c) The need to re-evaluate methodological approaches; and (d) The lack of research conducted in Malaysia. This review also provides suggestions and opportunities for future research in bilingualism and language processing.

Analyzing Stimuli Presentations and Exit-Interview Protocols to Improve Wearable Eye-Tracking Data Collection Guidelines for Reading Research,"H. Azman, Warid Mihat, Or-Kan Soh","Setting up an eye tracking experiment involves multitier processes that cover important issues such as developing the data collection guidelines, establishing data analysis protocols, and giving meaning to data. Although eye tracking handbooks have established imperative discussion on how the data should be analysed and written, there is still a dearth in the literature on data collection guidelines caused by the variety of features in different kinds of eye trackers. In this study, the researchers review the use of a wearable eye tracking apparatus with authentic materials and interview protocols. Exemplified through a preliminary study conducted on Year Six students in a primary school that investigates the internal processes of reading ESL texts, the significance and implications of using a wearable eye-tracking apparatus with a single point calibration are reported to improve the data collection guidelines.

Line planning in public transportation: models and methods,A. Schöbel,"The problem of defining suitable lines in a public transportation system (bus, railway, tram, or underground) is an important real-world problem that has also been well researched in theory. Driven by applications, it often lacks a clear description, but is rather stated in an informal way. This leads to a variety of different published line planning models. In this paper, we introduce some of the basic line planning models, identify their characteristics, and review literature on models, mathematical approaches, and algorithms for line planning.

Statistical Inference With Limited Memory: A Survey,"Tomer Berg, O. Ordentlich, O. Shayevitz","The problem of statistical inference in its various forms has been the subject of decades-long extensive research. Most of the effort has been focused on characterizing the behavior as a function of the number of available samples, with far less attention given to the effect of memory limitations on performance. Recently, this latter topic has drawn much interest in the engineering and computer science literature. In this survey paper, we attempt to review the state-of-the-art of statistical inference under memory constraints in several canonical problems, including hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and distribution property testing/estimation. We discuss the main results in this developing field, and by identifying recurrent themes, we extract some fundamental building blocks for algorithmic construction, as well as useful techniques for lower bound derivations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f56a32740482740c759ad8f6fc193477de0977eb,f56a32740482740c759ad8f6fc193477de0977eb,statistical inference limited memory survey,"Tomer Berg, O.

Management of Ludwig's Angina in Pregnancy: A Review of 10 Cases,"O. Osunde, G. Bassey, N. Ver-or","Background: Ludwig′s angina is a rapidly spreading cellulitis that may produce upper airway obstruction often leading to death. Aim: The present paper reviews the management of Ludwig′s angina in the third trimester of pregnancy. The inherent dangers to the mother and her unborn child are highlighted. Materials and Methods: The case files of pregnant patients who had emergent incision and drainage for life-threatening facial cellulitis at the maxillofacial unit of the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital in Kano, Nigeria, over a 2 year period were retrieved and demographic and clinical characteristics were retrospectively obtained and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 13.0, for Windows, September 2004, Chicago, Illinois). Comparative statistics were determined using Pearson′s Chi-square, Fisher′s exact tests and independent t tests as appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 10 patients were seen within the study period, age ranges from 23 to 40 years, mean 29.5 (5.3) years. Majority of the women were in their third decade [60% (6/10)] while the remaining 40% (4/10) were in their fourth decade of life. Two of the patients presented within the period of less than 1 week of onset of symptoms while those who presented within the periods of 1-2 weeks and periods of over 2 weeks accounted for 50% (5/10) and 30% (3/10) respectively. All the patients presented during the third trimester of their pregnancy and odontogenic infections were responsible for 80% (8/10) of the Ludwig′s angina. There were 20% mortality among the patients and this was significant for those with underlying systemic conditions (P = 0.02). The time of presentation was not significant for the survival rate of the gravid patient (P = 0.36) but was significant for survival of the fetus (P = 0.01). Conclusion: During a life-threatening infectious situation such as Ludwig′s angina, risks of maternal and fetal morbidity include both septicemia and asphyxia. Attending clinicians must consider the risks that the condition and the possible treatments may cause the mother and her unborn child.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a154576ca6cc67d5285e626735b61051301034a,6a154576ca6cc67d5285e626735b61051301034a,management ludwig 's angina pregnancy review 10 case,"O.

"Why are women missing from outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs? A review of multilevel factors affecting referral, enrollment, and completion.","L. Scott, K. Ben-Or, Jerilyn K. Allen","OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this paper are to (1) systematically review the evidence for patient, provider, and programmatic factors that may influence women's referral to, enrollment in, and completion of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and (2) make empirically based recommendations for future women's health research.


METHODS
Using a defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, this review involved a systematic review and description analysis of the published peer-review literature.


RESULTS
The review yielded 23 studies described in 25 publications. Although gaps in the knowledge base exist and several methodological concerns limit the evidence, this body of work suggests that age, personal resources, low rates of physician referral, and weak recommendations to participate in rehabilitation may explain why women are missing from this life-saving intervention.

Climate change and health in Israel: adaptation policies for extreme weather events,"Manfred S. Green, Noemie Groag Pri-or, G. Capeluto, Y. Epstein, S. Paz","Climatic changes have increased the world-wide frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, floods, storms and droughts. These extreme events potentially affect the health status of millions of people, increasing disease and death. Since mitigation of climate change is a long and complex process, emphasis has recently been placed on the measures required for adaptation. Although the principles underlying these measures are universal, preparedness plans and policies need to be tailored to local conditions. In this paper, we conducted a review of the literature on the possible health consequences of extreme weather events in Israel, where the conditions are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. Strong evidence indicates that the frequency and duration of several types of extreme weather events are increasing in the Mediterranean Basin, including Israel. We examined the public health policy implications for adaptation to climate change in the region, and proposed public health adaptation policy options. Preparedness for the public health impact of increased extreme weather events is still relatively limited and clear public health policies are urgently needed. These include improved early warning and monitoring systems, preparedness of the health system, educational programs and the living environment. Regional collaboration should be a priority.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f08a1f0b9ce98dbb0572e265d22a457eb2c8e83,1f08a1f0b9ce98dbb0572e265d22a457eb2c8e83,climate change health israel adaptation policy extreme weather event,"Manfred S.

Paper-Mill Wastes for Bioethanol Production in Relation to Circular Economy Concepts: A Review,"Dafna Or-Chen, Y. Gerchman, H. Mamane, Roi Peretz","This review explores circular economy principles in regard to ethanol production from paper-mill sludge. Environmental sustainability and renewability over fossil fuels make second generation ethanol an attractive energy source in a rapidly growing population and consumption world. Paper sludge (PS), a by-product of the pulp and paper (P&P) industry, can no longer be recycled for paper production and is mainly disposed of in landfills. Therefore, it poses a major environmental challenge. However, it has shown potential as a valuable raw material for ethanol production, along with other pulp and paper products, due to its abundant availability and high cellulosic content. This waste-to-energy (WtE) technology for ethanol production is proposed as an alternative, aligning with circular economy concepts to maximize resource efficiency and minimize waste. This review underlines the circular economy aspects of bioethanol production within paper mill sludge management systems. Circular economy principles applied to ethanol production from PS offer a promising avenue for sustainable biofuel development that not only addresses waste management challenges but also enhances the overall environmental performance of biofuel production.

"""Still work?"" Design and effect of interventions used to modify feeding problems in children with autism: A systematic review of studies employing group designs.","Louisa Ming Yan Chung, Yuan Fang, P. Or, F. Sun, E. Poon, Carmen Ka Man Chan","BACKGROUND
Feeding problems in children with autism jeopardize the well-being of both children with autism and their families. Mixed findings were reported from previous interventions, which were mostly evaluated by single subject research design (SSRD) studies. Moreover, feasibility assessment and social validity measurement were unaddressed by these SSRD studies. To fill this substantial knowledge gap, the present review systematically summarized and evaluated feeding interventions implemented in children with autism, which were assessed by studies employing group designs.


METHOD
An extensive literature search in eight established online databases was conducted, and a total of 17 eligible studies published in 2009-2021 were included for further analysis. A descriptive account of the features of the investigations is provided, including assessment of study quality.


RESULTS
A total of 449 children with autism and 203 parents/caregivers participated in the included studies. The multiple use of five strategic intervention components were highlighted in this review, including nutrition education/consultations, environmental modifications, sensory exposure, cognitive components, and behaviour interventions. The reviewed interventions showed a preliminarily positive effect for modifying feeding problems in children with autism. Furthermore, the evaluation based on the RE-AIM framework (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) demonstrated that an interdisciplinary multi-component intervention strategy may achieve high effectiveness and feasibility in improving feeding problems in a wide range of children with autism.


CONCLUSIONS
This review found that interventions achieved and maintained a positive effect on modification of feeding problems in groups of children with autism. Information and gaps identified and summarized in the implementation process may assist both researchers and stakeholders to further support these vulnerable children.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9eee1db7260bc33a295d8175c1f4f91df9582e13,9eee1db7260bc33a295d8175c1f4f91df9582e13,`` still work '' design effect intervention used modify feeding problem child autism systematic review study employing group design,"Louisa Ming Yan Chung, Yuan Fang, P.

A Review Paper on: Effect of Different Types of Filler Materials on Marshall Characteristics of Bitumen Hot Mix,"G. M. Harun-Or-Rashid, Mohammad Mohayminul Islam","Bituminous hot mix is one of the most widely used and costly flexible pavement layer. It involves a huge outlay of investment. Precise engineering and usage of proper materials can make it more cost efficient, durable, convenient for users and most importantly ecofriendly. To reduce the cost of construction engineers all over the globe are investigating for the alternative material to obtain same amount of output (strength, stability and durability) by paying a little. There are four constituents of a hot mix, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, binder and filler. Filler in the bitumen hot mix fill the void in between the aggregates which is very important for strength and stability of the pavement. But the fillers are conventionally used (cement and lime) are very costly which affect the total cost of construction. That’s why the researchers emphasized on the waste material to serve this purpose as well as to keep the environment clean. A large range of waste material like fly ash, bagasse ash, marble dust, stone dust, brick dust, kiln dust, waste concrete dust, foundry sand, bio gypsum, ceramic dust etc. has been use as a filler for numerous research works by the researchers globally. The materials yielded very satisfactory results. Fly ash, bagasse results in nearly same Marshall properties (stability, OBC, %VFA, %VMA, %Va) like the conventional one. Although the brick dust and stone dust provide a high amount of air voids but they also result high stability. More or less all these non-conventional materials are capable to fully or partially replace the conventional filler.

Meaningful Change and Treatment Responsivity in Intervention Research: A Targeted Review of Studies Published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology.,"Michael J Dolgin PhD, Ariel Asper Ba, Yair Greizer Ba, Yisca Kariel Ba, Meshi Malka Ba, Or Peretz Ba, Natan Rosenzweig Ba, Shani Shalev Ba, David E Sandberg PhD","OBJECTIVE
Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in pediatric psychology form the foundation for evidence-based treatment and best practices in the field. Relying heavily on continuous outcome measures and group comparisons, questions concerning meaningful clinical change and treatment response rates remain open. This targeted review aimed to provide an initial description of the current state of intervention research in pediatric psychology in terms of attention to meaningful clinical change and efforts to assess and characterize participants in terms of treatment responsivity.


METHODS
Online databases were used to identify a sample of RCT published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology from 2010 to 2021 using the term ""randomized"" in the title. Using predefined eligibility and exclusion criteria, 43 studies were identified and analyzed with regard to characteristics of intervention, population, measurement, data reporting, and reference to indicators of clinical significance, meaningful change, treatment responsivity rates, and predictors.


RESULTS
26 studies (60%) made no reference at all to meaningful clinical change, treatment response criteria and rates, or characteristics of treatment responders. 15 studies (35%) reported measures of meaningful change in their interpretation of group differences, to calculate sample size, in relation to baseline data only, or in describing a measure. 2 studies (5%) reported criteria for assessing meaningful change to determine individual response rates and characteristics of responders.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings highlight the need for greater emphasis on defining standards and analyzing treatment outcome research in terms of metrics of meaningful change and treatment response in order to better target intervention and optimize limited resources.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3284c97e98257ffa85233c990f8ee93cb7a9a0c,b3284c97e98257ffa85233c990f8ee93cb7a9a0c,meaningful change treatment responsivity intervention research targeted review study published journal pediatric psychology,"Michael J Dolgin PhD, Ariel Asper Ba, Yair Greizer Ba, Yisca Kariel Ba, Meshi Malka Ba, Or Peretz Ba, Natan Rosenzweig Ba, Shani Shalev Ba, David E Sandberg PhD",objective randomized-controlled trial rcts pediatric psychology form foundation evidence-based treatment best practice field relying heavily continuous outcome measure group comparison question concerning meaningful clinical change treatment response rate remain open targeted review aimed provide initial description current state intervention research pediatric psychology term attention meaningful clinical change effort assess characterize participant term treatment responsivity method online database used identify sample rct published journal pediatric psychology 2010 2021 using term `` randomized '' title using predefined eligibility exclusion criterion 43 study identified analyzed regard characteristic intervention population measurement data reporting reference indicator clinical significance meaningful change treatment responsivity rate predictor result 26 study 60 made reference meaningful clinical change treatment response criterion rate characteristic treatment responder 15 study 35 reported measure meaningful change interpretation group difference calculate sample size relation baseline data describing measure 2 study 5 reported criterion assessing meaningful change determine individual response rate characteristic responder conclusion finding highlight need greater emphasis defining standard analyzing treatment outcome research term metric meaningful change treatment response order better target intervention optimize limited resource,meaningful change treatment responsivity intervention research targeted review study published journal pediatric psychology objective randomized-controlled trial rcts pediatric psychology form foundation evidence-based treatment best practice field relying heavily continuous outcome measure group comparison question concerning meaningful clinical change treatment response rate remain open targeted review aimed provide initial description current state intervention research pediatric psychology term attention meaningful clinical change effort assess characterize participant term treatment responsivity method online database used identify sample rct published journal pediatric psychology 2010 2021 using term `` randomized '' title using predefined eligibility exclusion criterion 43 study identified analyzed regard characteristic intervention population measurement data reporting reference indicator clinical significance meaningful change treatment responsivity rate predictor result 26 study 60 made reference meaningful clinical change treatment response criterion rate characteristic treatment responder 15 study 35 reported measure meaningful change interpretation group difference calculate sample size relation baseline data describing measure 2 study 5 reported criterion assessing meaningful change determine individual response rate characteristic responder conclusion finding highlight need greater emphasis defining standard analyzing treatment outcome research term metric meaningful change treatment response order better target intervention optimize limited resource,0,0_health_patient_review_study
Lab-on-a-Chip Electrochemical Biosensors for Foodborne Pathogen Detection: A Review of Common Standards and Recent Progress,"Or Zolti, Baviththira Suganthan, R. Ramasamy","Foodborne pathogens are an important diagnostic target for the food, beverage, and health care industries due to their prevalence and the adverse effects they can cause to public health, food safety, and the economy. The standards that determine whether a given type of food is fit for consumption are set by governments and must be taken into account when designing a new diagnostic tool such as a biosensor platform. In order to meet these stringent detection limits, cost, and reliability standards, recent research has been focused on developing lab-on-a-chip-based approaches for detection devices that use microfluidic channels and platforms. The microfluidics-based devices are designed, developed, and used in different ways to achieve the established common standards for food pathogen testing that enable high throughput, rapid detection, low sample volume, and minimal pretreatment procedures. Combining microfluidic approaches with electrochemical biosensing could offer affordable, portable, and easy to use devices for food pathogen diagnostics.

A unique construct was mandated, consisting of 20 national teams in Phase I and 19 teams in Phase II (with research topics spanning from basic to clinical science to health resource systems) along with cross-cutting programs to support them. Responding to the needs of researchers within the CCNA teams, a unique sample of 1173 deeply phenotyped patients with various forms of dementia was accrued and studied over eight years (COMPASS-ND). In the second phase of funding (2019-2024), a national dementia prevention program (CAN-THUMBS UP) was set up. In a short time, this prevention program became a member of the World Wide FINGERS prevention consortium. In this article, the challenges, successes, and impacts of CCNA in Canada and internationally are discussed. Short-term deliverables have occurred, along with considerable promise of impacts in the longer term. The creation of synergy, networking, capacity building, engagement of people with lived experience, and economies of scale have contributed to the considerable success of CCNA by all measures.

Cutting-edge Strategies for Scaling Down Pain in Orthopaedic Surgery: A Comprehensive Review,"OR Jeff Walter Rajadurai, CS Likhit, Shailesh Kumar, P. D. Kanna","Postoperative musculoskeletal pain is a significant challenge in orthopaedic surgery, leading to discomfort, restricted mobility and delayed recovery. Effective pain management strategies are crucial for optimising patient outcomes, reducing opioid reliance and enhancing recovery. The present review examines recent advancements in pain management techniques, focusing on multimodal analgesia, regional anaesthesia and non pharmacological interventions. The findings highlight the efficacy of multimodal analgesia, which integrates pharmacological approaches such as opioids, Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and N-MethylD-Aspartate (NMDA) antagonists with non pharmacological methods like Radiofrequency (RF) ablation, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS). Innovations such as oliceridine offer effective opioid alternatives with fewer side-effects. Regional anaesthesia techniques, particularly nerve blocks, demonstrate significant potential in reducing opioid consumption and promoting recovery. The integration of these strategies has significantly advanced postoperative care, reducing opioid dependence and improving pain management.

A Systematic Literature Review of Factors Influencing Marital Readiness,"Icha Herawati, Suzana Mohd Hoesni, J. Manap, or Azzatunnisak Mohd Khatib","There is a risk of bias in the research since current literature review frameworks frequently lack measurement of the volume of literature, guidance on keyword inclusion, confidence in detecting knowledge gaps, and framing of research objectives. This calls into question the review's legitimacy and dependability. In order to overcome these difficulties, we want to enhance the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, which begins with a literature review and is then followed by another literature review. The researchers used a systematic literature review approach, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), to obtain relevant publications related to young people's marriage readiness. This process was divided into three main stages: identification, screening, and eligibility. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were the two main databases used in the study, containing over 33,000 journals spanning over 256 disciplines, such as psychology, environmental studies, developmental studies, and integrative social sciences. Primary research, psychological marriage readiness, readiness to marry, adolescent and young adult populations aged 1 to 25 years, and papers in English were the inclusion criteria for this study. Based on prior research findings, it has been shown that various aspects, including financial, emotional, sexual, personality, and mental readiness, are significant determinants of a person's marital readiness. This comprehensive literature review indicates that marriage readiness is influenced by three key aspects: individual, financial, and social factors.

Morvaridi","Background Zataria multiflora (Z. multiflora), also known as Shirazi thyme, is recognized for its medicinal properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Its longstanding use in traditional medicine for respiratory ailments underscores its significance. Given the widespread prevalence of respiratory disorders and inconclusive outcomes from previous trials, this research aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate Z. multiflora’s impact on respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and oxidative stress markers using available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search of published literature was conducted up to January 2024, encompassing databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central for Randomized Clinical Trials. The assessment of the quality of each eligible study was conducted using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The random-effects model was used in the meta-analysis to determine the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version 15). Results A total of 9 studies involving 394 participants were included. The administration of Z. multiflora showed significant effects on cough (WMD: -0.99; 95% CI: -1.66, -0.33; P = 0.003), day wheezing (WMD: -1.18; 95% CI: -1.44, -0.92; P < 0.001), night wheezing (WMD: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.09, -0.37; P < 0.001), chest wheezing (WMD: -1.15; 95% CI: -1.65, -0.64; P < 0.001), forced expiratory volume (WMD: 11.38; 95% CI: 7.40, 15.35; P < 0.001), forced vital capacity (WMD: 16.01; 95% CI: 12.26, 19.75; P < 0.001), and peak expiratory flow (WMD: 8.78; 95% CI: 4.13, 13.43; P < 0.001) compared to the control group. Additionally, Z. multiflora significantly reduced malondialdehyde levels (SMD: -1.54; 95% CI: -2.17, -0.90; P < 0.001) and increased catalase levels (SMD: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.46; P < 0.001). Conclusion Z. multiflora shows potential as a complementary treatment for respiratory diseases by improving symptoms, pulmonary functions, and reducing oxidative stress.

Effectiveness of Using Virtual Reality–Supported Exercise Therapy for Upper Extremity Motor Rehabilitation in Patients With Stroke: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Jiayin Chen, C. Or, Tianrong Chen","Background In recent years, efforts have been made to implement virtual reality (VR) to support the delivery of poststroke upper extremity motor rehabilitation exercises. Therefore, it is important to review and analyze the existing research evidence of its effectiveness. Objective Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, this study examined the effectiveness of using VR-supported exercise therapy for upper extremity motor rehabilitation in patients with stroke. Methods This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched on December 31, 2021. Changes in outcomes related to impairments in upper extremity functions and structures, activity limitations, and participation restrictions in life situations from baseline to after intervention, after intervention to follow-up assessment, and baseline to follow-up assessment were examined. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether the differences in treatment outcomes depended on age, stroke recovery stage, VR program type, therapy delivery format, similarities in intervention duration between study groups, intervention duration in VR groups, and trial length. Results A total of 42 publications representing 43 trials (aggregated sample size=1893) were analyzed. Compared with the control groups that used either conventional therapy or no therapy, the intervention groups that used VR to support exercise therapy showed significant improvements in upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity; SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.68; P<.001), range of motion (goniometer; SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.50-1.52; P<.001), muscle strength (Manual Muscle Testing; SMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.28-1.30; P=.002), and independence in day-to-day activities (Functional Independence Measure; SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.06-0.40; P=.01, and modified Rankin Scale; SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.01-1.12; P=.046). Significant subgroup differences were observed in hand dexterity (Box and Block Test), spasticity (Ashworth Scale or modified Ashworth Scale), arm and hand motor ability (Wolf Motor Function Test and Manual Function Test), hand motor ability (Jebsen Hand Function Test), and quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale). There was no evidence that the benefits of VR-supported exercise therapy were maintained after the intervention ended. Conclusions VR-supported upper extremity exercise therapy can be effective in improving motor rehabilitation results. Our review showed that of the 12 rehabilitation outcomes examined during the course of VR-based therapy, significant improvements were detected in 2 (upper extremity motor function and range of motion), and both significant and nonsignificant improvements were observed in another 2 (muscle strength and independence in day-to-day activities), depending on the measurement tools or methods used.

The association between parenting quality and offspring's biological aging evaluated by telomere length: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Shlomit Fogel-Yaakobi, Ilanit Gordon, Michal Lavidor, Or Burstein, Neta Salomon, D. Shai","There is widespread agreement that offspring are shaped by the parenting they receive in early childhood. This development is intertwined with offspring's biological functioning, evidenced by their telomeres length (TL)-a key biomarker of aging. Until recently, most studies have focused on the detrimental implications of negative parenting for offspring's TL. Contemporary research is oriented toward exploring the possible resilience-promoting effect of positive parenting on the biological aging of the offspring. We conducted a meta-analysis synthesizing the findings regarding the association between parenting quality and offspring's TL. It examines whether positive parenting delays aging processes and whether such processes are exacerbated by exposure to negative parenting. An analysis of 15 studies (k = 23; N = 3,599, M mean cohort's age = 15.5, SD = 17.5) revealed a significant association between positive parenting and offspring's longer TL (r = .16, 95% CI [.11, .20]). Negative parenting was associated with an increased risk of TL erosion (r = -.17, 95% CI [-.28, -.06]). Moreover, this negative association became more robust as offspring grew older (β = -.01, p < .001). Future investigations would benefit from probing associations between parental quality and offspring's development.

Review of sedimentary basin evolution in Cambodia based on tectonic setting and logical information,"Sreymean Sio, Chanmoly Or, Chandoeun Eng, Sopheap Pech, Tola Sreu","The paper aims to synthesize the evolution of sedimentary basins in Cambodia based on a comprehensive information on tectonic setting and existing database of their formation and sedimentation. The study includes a review on tectonic setting of Indochina, the formation of sedimentary basins around Cambodia, and the accessible data on sedimentary basins in Cambodia. Indochina, as well as Cambodia, had been influenced by the collision of three different plates or terranes such as the South China, Sibumasu-Sukhothai, and Paleo-Pacific that are associated with the evolution of Paleozoic-Mesozoic Basins namely Khorat and Kampong Som Basins. These two oldest basins, are interpreted as a Paleozoic – Mesozoic foreland basin that initially formed due to rifting during the Late Carboniferous to Late Permian, and later basin inversion and erosion took place due to the Mesozoic to earliest Cenozoic uplift. Then, Cambodia was affected by Tertiary strike-slip fault movements that also influenced the formation of Tonle Sap, Svayrieng and Khmer Tertiary rift basins. Tonle Sap and Svayrieng Basins are interpreted to be formed by extension during the Middle Eocene – Early Oligocene and inversion, uplift and denudation during the Miocene. The Khmer Basin was formed by rifting during the Eocene to the Late Oligocene, followed by rapid thermal subsidence from the Early to Middle Miocene. Finally, Khmer basin was affected by the Middle – Late Miocene to Pleistocene inversion.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a932f50c230e86e67c8c09d50286a5d0232bfac4,a932f50c230e86e67c8c09d50286a5d0232bfac4,review sedimentary basin evolution cambodia based tectonic setting logical information,"Sreymean Sio, Chanmoly Or, Chandoeun Eng, Sopheap Pech, Tola Sreu",paper aim synthesize evolution sedimentary basin cambodia based comprehensive information tectonic setting existing database formation sedimentation study includes review tectonic setting indochina formation sedimentary basin around cambodia accessible data sedimentary basin cambodia indochina well cambodia influenced collision three different plate terranes south china sibumasu-sukhothai paleo-pacific associated evolution paleozoic-mesozoic basin namely khorat kampong som basin two oldest basin interpreted paleozoic – mesozoic foreland basin initially formed due rifting late carboniferous late permian later basin inversion erosion took place due mesozoic earliest cenozoic uplift cambodia affected tertiary strike-slip fault movement also influenced formation tonle sap svayrieng khmer tertiary rift basin tonle sap svayrieng basin interpreted formed extension middle eocene – early oligocene inversion uplift denudation miocene khmer basin formed rifting eocene late oligocene followed rapid thermal subsidence early middle miocene finally khmer basin affected middle – late miocene pleistocene inversion,review sedimentary basin evolution cambodia based tectonic setting logical information paper aim synthesize evolution sedimentary basin cambodia based comprehensive information tectonic setting existing database formation sedimentation study includes review tectonic setting indochina formation sedimentary basin around cambodia accessible data sedimentary basin cambodia indochina well cambodia influenced collision three different plate terranes south china sibumasu-sukhothai paleo-pacific associated evolution paleozoic-mesozoic basin namely khorat kampong som basin two oldest basin interpreted paleozoic – mesozoic foreland basin initially formed due rifting late carboniferous late permian later basin inversion erosion took place due mesozoic earliest cenozoic uplift cambodia affected tertiary strike-slip fault movement also influenced formation tonle sap svayrieng khmer tertiary rift basin tonle sap svayrieng basin interpreted formed extension middle eocene – early oligocene inversion uplift denudation miocene khmer basin formed rifting eocene late oligocene followed rapid thermal subsidence early middle miocene finally khmer basin affected middle – late miocene pleistocene inversion,2,2_soil_microbial_paper_habitat

To ascertain the advantages of plum consumption on adult lipid profiles, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis. We used pertinent keywords to search the databases of PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to November 10th, 2022, in order to find trials that were eligible. According to the analyses, eating plum significantly lowers LDL levels compared to controls (WMD: −12.50 mg/dL, 95% CI: −22.06, −2.94, p = .010). Although plum consumption did not result in significant changes in TG (WMD: 0.56 mg/dL, 95% CI: −6.02, 7.15, p = .866), TC (WMD: −12.35 mg/dL, 95% CI: −25.05, 0.37, p = .057), and HDL concentrations (WMD: −0.39 mg/dL, 95% CI: −4.69, 3.89, p = .855) compared to the control group. Intake of plums, particularly the intervention type of dried plums, significantly decreased TC levels in unhealthy subjects, according to subgroup analysis.

Hwang, Jonathan Regenold, Wataru Matsumiya, B. Pham, M. Zaidi, Azadeh Mobasserian, Anthony Toan DongChau, C. Or, Ç. Yaşar, K. Mishra, D. Do, Q. Nguyen","Abstract Gene therapy has emerged as a research topic of choice in recent years. The eye in particular is one of few organs of the body for which gene therapy has received Food and Drug Administration approval, and it remains a field of great interest for gene therapy development. However, its associated immune and inflammatory reactions may render the treatment ineffective or harmful, which are of particular concern for the eyes due to their susceptibility to inflammation. The severity of immune and inflammatory reactions depends on the choice of vector and its route of administration. Furthermore, most preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the dose of vectors is correlated with the degree of humoral response and ocular inflammation. The route of administration directly impacts the degree of immune and inflammatory reaction. Subretinal delivery produces a weaker humoral response than the intravitreal route. However, some studies have demonstrated that the subretinal delivery induces a stronger inflammatory reaction. On the other hand, several instances of vision loss due to severe late onset intraocular inflammation were reported in a clinical trial involving intravitreal delivery of viral vectors. When compared with the intravitreal route, suprachoroidal gene delivery has been shown to produce weaker humoral response. However, unlike the subretinal space, the suprachoroidal space is not known to have immune privilege status. Inflammatory reactions following ocular gene therapy are typically mild and most clinical and preclinical studies have shown that they can be controlled with topical, local or systemic steroids. However, severe inflammatory responses may occur and require aggressive management to avoid permanent vision loss. Further investigations are required to elucidate and expand our knowledge of inflammatory reactions, and their optimal management, following ocular gene therapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae550896a321218094b1d0dea404d3ef8f5f430a,ae550896a321218094b1d0dea404d3ef8f5f430a,ocular gene therapy literature review special focus immune inflammatory response,"H.

In this study, we systematically reviewed qualitative studies concerning patients' experience with medicinal cannabis (MC) use, to gain insight into the negative effects of MC.


BACKGROUND
Over the past decades, the use of MC for therapeutic purposes has increased. However, there is conflicting and insufficient data on possible negative physiological and psychological effects of MC treatment.


DESIGN
A systematic review was conducted and the PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist used to assess risk of bias in the included studies.


METHODS
We included studies focusing on conventional medical treatment using cannabis-based products, approved by a physician for a particular health issue.


RESULTS
Of the 1230 articles identified in the initial search, eight articles were included in the review. Following the compilation of themes in the eligible studies, six themes were identified: (1) MC approval; (2) administrative barriers; (3) social perception; (4) MC misuse/widespread effect; (5) adverse effects; and (6) dependence or addiction. These were grouped into two meta-themes: (1) administrative and social aspects of MC use; and (2) experiences of the effects of medicinal cannabis.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings call for specific attention to unique consequences associated with MC use. Further research is needed in order to assess the degree to which negative experiences associated with MC use may affect various aspects of patients' medical condition.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Describing the complex experience of MC treatment and its spectrum of consequences for patients may enable physicians, therapists and researchers to provide more attentive and accurate MC treatment to their patients.

Feline cognitive dysfunction as a model for Alzheimer’s disease in the research of CBD as a potential treatment—a narrative review,"Lilach Zadik-Weiss, Sivan Ritter, Vered Hermush, N. Asher, A. Avital, R. Or","With the improvement in modern medicine, the world’s human and feline (Felis catus, the domestic cat) population is aging. As the population grows older, there is an increase of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease in humans and feline cognitive dysfunction in felines, which shares many similarities with Alzheimer’s disease. They both result in cognitive decline and lack effective treatments. In light of their pathological similarities, both occur at old age, and as domestic cats share the human environment and risk factors (cats are considered an indicator to the effect of environmental contaminants on humans as they share exposures and diseases), cats have the potential to be a spontaneous model for Alzheimer’s disease. Classic animal models in many cases fail to predict the results in humans, and a natural model can lead to better prediction of results, thus being both time and cost-effective. The feline disease can be researched in trials that could be simultaneously clinical trials for cats and preclinical trials for humans, also referred to as reverse translational medicine. As both maladies lack effective medical intervention, new potential treatments are merited. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a promising agent that may improve the life of these patients, as it was shown to potentially treat several of the pathologies found in both conditions. yet there is a need for further research in order to establish the benefits and safety of CBD to both human and feline patients.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8a57440f6fb96fc14d5cf7b74f880c3a9db3120,c8a57440f6fb96fc14d5cf7b74f880c3a9db3120,feline cognitive dysfunction model alzheimer ’ disease research cbd potential treatment—a narrative review,"Lilach Zadik, Sivan Ritter, Vered Hermush, N.

Research progress of recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine,"Or Hokwan, Xiaohan Zhang","The coronavirus situation is dire around the world, with more than 594 million confirmed infections and nearly 6.45 million deaths. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have a high level of genomic similarity (peak glycoprotein serial similarity of 87.2%) , which provide a basis for vaccine development. In the context of the 2022 novel coronavirus pandemic, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that can effectively protect against the virus that must be relatively safe while being effective and predictable as well. We found that recombinant protein vaccines seem to be able to effectively solve most of the current problems after comparing several existing vaccines.

Review Paper: A Systematic Review of Patient Acceptance of Consumer Health Information Technology,"C. Or, B. Karsh","A systematic literature review was performed to identify variables promoting consumer health information technology (CHIT) acceptance among patients. The electronic bibliographic databases Web of Science, Business Source Elite, CINAHL, Communication and Mass Media Complete, MEDLINE, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo were searched. A cited reference search of articles meeting the inclusion criteria was also conducted to reduce misses. Fifty-two articles met the selection criteria. Among them, 94 different variables were tested for associations with acceptance. Most of those tested (71%) were patient factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, health- and treatment-related variables, and prior experience or exposure to computer/health technology. Only ten variables were related to human-technology interaction; 16 were organizational factors; and one was related to the environment. In total, 62 (66%) were found to predict acceptance in at least one study. Existing literature focused largely on patient-related factors. No studies examined the impact of social and task factors on acceptance, and few tested the effects of organizational or environmental factors on acceptance. Future research guided by technology acceptance theories should fill those gaps to improve our understanding of patient CHIT acceptance, which in turn could lead to better CHIT design and implementation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/320476720a40383508cd919ce1c818d0d5bdc60f,320476720a40383508cd919ce1c818d0d5bdc60f,review paper systematic review patient acceptance consumer health information technology,"C.

This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research.

Systematic review of personal finance training for physicians and a proposed curriculum,"J. Igu, S. Zakaria, Yuval D Bar-Or","Background Many physicians complete medical school and graduate medical education (GME) burdened by high debt and financial illiteracy. This places them at increased risk for ill-informed financial decisions, which can result in increased stress and anxiety and a lower quality of life. Furthermore, financial concerns impact physicians’ specialty selections and may partly explain the scarcity of primary care practitioners. In response, medical wellness programmes have increasingly sought to offer personal finance education, but there is little guidance on optimal curricula. Our objective is to systematically review the existing literature examining physician financial literacy curricula and to recommend a standardised personal finance curriculum. Methods This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 checklist to report the results of literature searches in PubMed, ERIC, MedEdPortal, EBSCO, JSTOR and Google Scholar. Three researchers used predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select articles, including a focus on financial concepts applicable in the USA. Selected articles published between 2000 and 2022 were assessed using the BEME strength of findings tool, and further assessed using modified Côté-Turgeon and Kirkpatrick model qualitative analyses tools. Findings 49 articles met all inclusion criteria. Ten specifically described personal finance literacy curricula for medical students or GME trainees, with varied criteria for selecting instructors, topics and outcomes. All studies reported that audiences were ill prepared for making financial decisions but strongly desired financial literacy education. Qualitative analysis revealed Strength of Findings summary scores ranging from 2 to 4, while applicable Kirkpatrick Model scores were all 3 or greater. Based on these findings, a 14-module personal finance curriculum is proposed by the researchers, along with learning objectives. Interpretation Although medical students and GME trainees value financial literacy, few publications report the impact of actual curricula. These efforts vary in depth, breadth and measured impact. Future research should focus on development of valid testing instruments specifically for physicians, content standardisation, selection of credible instructors and delivery formats.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4761d8abbaa3987a95d222a76fbd3294890f9b4f,4761d8abbaa3987a95d222a76fbd3294890f9b4f,systematic review personal finance training physician proposed curriculum,"J.

"Early attachment networks to multiple caregivers: History, assessment models, and future research recommendations.","Or Dagan, A. Sagi-Schwartz","Early attachment has been commonly hypothesized to predict children's future developmental outcomes, and robust evidence relying on assessments of single caregiver-child attachment patterns has corroborated this hypothesis. Nevertheless, most often children are raised by multiple caregivers, and they tend to form attachment bonds with more than one of them. In this paper, we briefly describe the conceptual and empirical roots underlying the notion of attachment networks to multiple caregivers. We detail potential reasons for research focusing on a single caregiver (most often mothers, but recently also fathers) and the historical attempts to establish a more ecologically valid assessment of attachment to multiple caregivers. Finally, we describe a recently developed organizational framework that includes testable models on which future research may rely for assessing the predictive power of attachment networks to multiple caregivers on children's developmental outcomes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4b49d909c4800dc1d6739c556f3319c4dd46b00,f4b49d909c4800dc1d6739c556f3319c4dd46b00,early attachment network multiple caregiver history assessment model future research recommendation,"Or Dagan, A.

The Open Studio Approach to Art Therapy: A Systematic Scoping Review,"Daniel N. Finkel, Michal Bat Or","This research encompasses a systematic scoping review of literature and research pertaining to the open studio approach to art therapy, which originated with the work of artists in psychiatric hospitals in the 1940's. As art therapy became a profession, it sought recognition by adopting theories from other therapeutic disciplines. Today, however, there is an increase in the prevalence of studio practice that emphasizes art as the core of the therapeutic work; moreover, contemporary art therapy approaches even venture beyond the traditional definition of the profession to the realm of social action. Consequently, open studio practice has become more widespread and is currently implemented in many different contexts among a wide range of populations. The purpose of this research was to accurately map out world literature and research on the open studio approach to art therapy as well as identify relevant publications and main themes. Therefore, the systematic scoping review was not restricted to specific periods, languages, settings, or populations. Publications were identified through a rigorous, replicable, and extensive search of international literature in data bases and hand searches in art therapy journals; in addition, special efforts were made to locate unpublished research and literature. Data was charted using a tool developed by the researchers, based on the review questions. Results indicate that most of the literature relating to the open studio approach dates from the 1990's: only a few earlier publications were found. Over the last decade, the literature has grown in volume in comparison to previous decades, reflecting an increasing prevalence of the open studio approach. This growing mass of publications reflects an historic development in the field of art therapy. This research also identifies core principles as well as a wide range of variations on the open studio model, in addition to unique characteristics that vary according to context and therapeutic approach. It explores open studio practice within different settings and populations and pinpoints gaps of knowledge that can indicate the need for further research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/744fc3c2e6e09ae518ada519cc579127b77b657f,744fc3c2e6e09ae518ada519cc579127b77b657f,open studio approach art therapy systematic scoping review,"Daniel N.

"Use of OCTA, FA, and Ultra‐Widefield Imaging in Quantifying Retinal Ischemia: A Review","C. Or, A. S. Sabrosa, Osama A. Sorour, M. Arya, N. Waheed","Abstract: As ischemia remains a key prognostic factor in the management of various diseases including diabetic retinopathy, an increasing amount of research has been dedicated to its quantification as a potential biomarker. Advancements in the quantification of retinal ischemia have been made with the imaging modalities of fluorescein angiography (FA), ultra‐widefield imaging (UWF), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), with each imaging modality offering certain benefits over the others. FA remains the gold standard in assessing the extent of ischemia. UWF imaging has allowed for the assessment of peripheral ischemia via FA. It is, however, OCTA that offers the best visualization of retinal vasculature with its noninvasive depth‐resolved imaging and therefore has the potential to become a mainstay in the assessment of retinal ischemia. The primary purpose of this article is to review the use of FA, UWF, and OCTA to quantify retinal ischemia and the various methods described in the literature by which this is achieved.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d37acd9340feebe87b062d02c6cf7dda6463c4aa,d37acd9340feebe87b062d02c6cf7dda6463c4aa,use octa fa ultra‐widefield imaging quantifying retinal ischemia review,"C.

Thus, this was the first paper that showed a body-specific space-valence mapping. These highly influential findings led to a substantial body of research and follow-up studies, which could confirm the original findings on a conceptual level. However, direct replications of the original study are scarce.

Submit-to-Accept Times in Accounting: Determinants and Comparisons to Other Business Disciplines,"Patrick J. Hurley, Ronen Gal-Or, W. R. Knechel, Heather L. Pesch","
 We use hand-collected data to analyze submission-to-acceptance (STA) times in the top-tier accounting journals relative to other top-tier business journals from 1993 through 2021. We find that, vis-à-vis other business disciplines, STA times at top-tier accounting journals were shorter in the first half of our sample period and significantly longer thereafter. We also observe shorter STA times for articles with authors from more highly ranked institutions; this effect exists only in top-tier accounting journals and has increased over time. In additional analyses, we find that our primary inferences are unchanged when considering maturity of initial journal submissions, journal-level democratization, and review process improvements related to paper quality. Our results should be of interest to researchers, journal editors, reviewers, provosts, deans, and tenure and promotion committees.

Tiled Diffusion,"Or Madar, Ohad Fried","Image tiling -- the seamless connection of disparate images to create a coherent visual field -- is crucial for applications such as texture creation, video game asset development, and digital art. Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360$^\circ$ synthesis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4c009c0439c310994790b6b3720c9548756c972,c4c009c0439c310994790b6b3720c9548756c972,tiled diffusion,"Or Madar, Ohad Fried",image tiling -- seamless connection disparate image create coherent visual field -- crucial application texture creation video game asset development digital art traditionally tile constructed manually method pose significant limitation scalability flexibility recent research attempted automate process using generative model however current approach primarily focus tiling texture manipulating model single-image generation without inherently supporting creation multiple interconnected tile across diverse domain paper present tiled diffusion novel approach extends capability diffusion model accommodate generation cohesive tiling pattern across various domain image synthesis require tiling method support wide range tiling scenario self-tiling complex many-to-many connection enabling seamless integration multiple image tiled diffusion automates tiling process eliminating need manual intervention enhancing creative possibility various application seamlessly tiling existing image tiled texture creation 360 ^\circ synthesis,tiled diffusion image tiling -- seamless connection disparate image create coherent visual field -- crucial application texture creation video game asset development digital art traditionally tile constructed manually method pose significant limitation scalability flexibility recent research attempted automate process using generative model however current approach primarily focus tiling texture manipulating model single-image generation without inherently supporting creation multiple interconnected tile across diverse domain paper present tiled diffusion novel approach extends capability diffusion model accommodate generation cohesive tiling pattern across various domain image synthesis require tiling method support wide range tiling scenario self-tiling complex many-to-many connection enabling seamless integration multiple image tiled diffusion automates tiling process eliminating need manual intervention enhancing creative possibility various application seamlessly tiling existing image tiled texture creation 360 ^\circ synthesis,7,7_motion_de_object_camera

"Effects of technology-supported exercise programs on the knee pain, physical function, and quality of life of individuals with knee osteoarthritis and/or chronic knee pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Tianrong Chen, C. Or, Jiayin Chen","OBJECTIVE
The study sought to examine the effects of technology-supported exercise programs on the knee pain, physical function, and quality of life of individuals with knee osteoarthritis and/or chronic knee pain by a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to August 2020. A meta-analysis and subgroup analyses, stratified by technology type and program feature, were conducted.


RESULTS
Twelve randomized controlled trials were reviewed, all of which implemented the programs for 4 weeks to 6 months. Telephone, Web, mobile app, computer, and virtual reality were used to deliver the programs. The meta-analysis showed that these programs were associated with significant improvements in knee pain (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.48 to -0.10; P = .003) and quality of life (SMD = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.46; P = .02) but not with significant improvement in physical function (SMD = 0.22; 95% CI, 0 to 0.43; P = .053). Subgroup analyses showed that some technology types and program features were suggestive of potential benefits.

PDBs Go Numeric: Pattern-Database Heuristics for Simple Numeric Planning,"Daniel Gnad, Lee-or Alon, Eyal Weiss, Alexander Shleyfman","Despite the widespread success of pattern database (PDB) heuristics in classical planning, to date there has been no application of PDBs to planning with numeric variables. In this paper we attempt to close this gap. We address optimal numeric planning involving conditions characterized by linear expressions and actions that modify numeric variables by constant quantities. Building upon prior research, we present an adaptation of PDB heuristics to numeric planning, introducing several approaches to deal with the unbounded nature of numeric variable projections. These approaches aim to restrict the initially infinite projections, thereby bounding the number of states and ultimately constraining the resulting PDBs.

Genetic-based diagnostics of Parkinson's disease and other Parkinsonian syndromes.,"Emma N. Somerville, Z. Gan-Or","INTRODUCTION
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disorder with vast clinical heterogeneity. Recent genetic, imaging and clinical evidence suggest that there are multiple subtypes of PD, and perhaps even distinct clinical entities, which are being diagnosed under the umbrella of PD. These might have similar clinical presentation, but potentially different underlying mechanisms, which, in future, will require different treatments. Despite extensive genetic research progress, genetic testing is still not a common practice in clinical patient care.


AREAS COVERED
This review examines the numerous genes that have been discovered to affect the risk of, or cause, PD. We also outline genetic variants that affect PD age at onset, its progression, and the presence or severity of motor and non-motor symptoms. We differentiate between PD, other synucleinopathies, and atypical parkinsonism syndromes, and describe genes responsible for familial forms of typical PD and atypical parkinsonism. Lastly, we present current clinical trails that are underway for targeted therapies, particularly for GBA1-PD and LRRK2-PD which are the most significant subtypes.


EXPERT OPINION
While genetic studies alone cannot be diagnostic for PD, proper utilization of genetic screening for PD could improve diagnostic accuracy and predictions for prognosis, guide treatment, and identify individuals that qualify for clinical trials.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/280f1eb6de0c901c27bbafcd81c6e7680e457a8f,280f1eb6de0c901c27bbafcd81c6e7680e457a8f,genetic-based diagnostics parkinson 's disease parkinsonian syndrome,"Emma N.

Feasibility of iMagLS-BSM - ILD Informed Binaural Signal Matching with Arbitrary Microphone Arrays,"Or Berebi, Zamir Ben-Hur, D. Alon, B. Rafaely","Binaural reproduction for headphone-centric listening has become a focal point in ongoing research, particularly within the realm of advancing technologies such as augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR). The demand for high-quality spatial audio in these applications is essential to uphold a seamless sense of immersion. However, challenges arise from wearable recording devices equipped with only a limited number of microphones and irregular microphone placements due to design constraints. These factors contribute to limited reproduction quality compared to reference signals captured by high-order microphone arrays. This paper introduces a novel optimization loss tailored for a beamforming-based, signal-independent binaural reproduction scheme. This method, named iMagLS-BSM incorporates an interaural level difference (ILD) error term into the previously proposed binaural signal matching (BSM) magnitude least squares (MagLS) rendering loss for lateral plane angles. The method leverages nonlinear programming to minimize the introduced loss. Preliminary results show a substantial reduction in ILD error, while maintaining a binaural magnitude error comparable to that achieved with a MagLS BSM solution. These findings hold promise for enhancing the overall spatial quality of resultant binaural signals.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c07ad66f7d00083c4e09f87ae425954d8054742,0c07ad66f7d00083c4e09f87ae425954d8054742,feasibility imagls-bsm ild informed binaural signal matching arbitrary microphone array,"Or Berebi, Zamir Ben, D.

Influence of Culture on Chinese University Students' Interaction with Feedback,"Vladislav Ilin, Jiaming Ke, Sunantana Nuanla-or","Feedback is a powerful learning tool, however, cultural elements may inhibit its effectiveness. In China, the teacher-student dynamics are different than in the West and the methodologies purported by Western scholars may not be effective.

The research explores the needs and perspectives on feedback practices of twenty-five senior undergraduate students at a Chinese University via semi-structured interviews. The results offer insight into best feedback practices when working with Chinese students. The key takeaway is that most Western effective feedback guidelines translate into the Chinese classroom, however, power dynamics inherent in Confucianist society inhibit students from engaging with teachers.

Watch That Attitude! Examining the Role of Attitude in the Technology Acceptance Model through Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modelling,Caleb Or,"The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), proposed by Fred Davis in 1986, is a foundational framework for understanding technology adoption, emphasizing Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) as key determinants of Intention to Use (ITU). While Attitude Toward Using (ATU) was initially central to TAM, it was later omitted in iterations like TAM2 and UTAUT. This paper revisits the role of ATU within TAM, employing One-Step Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modelling (OSMASEM) to analyze educational technology acceptance. The findings reveal that ATU significantly mediates the relationship between PEOU, PU, and ITU, enhancing the explanatory power of TAM. By comparing models with and without ATU (TAM-O and TAM-R), the findings demonstrate that incorporating ATU provides a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior, particularly in voluntary use contexts. The study underscores the importance of attitudes in technology adoption and suggests that future TAM iterations should consider ATU to improve predictive accuracy. This research contributes to theoretical advancements in TAM and offers practical insights for enhancing technology acceptance in educational settings.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fab3c13778ca4288ff900acc3de0374b95869c30,fab3c13778ca4288ff900acc3de0374b95869c30,watch attitude examining role attitude technology acceptance model meta-analytic structural equation modelling,Caleb Or,technology acceptance model tam proposed fred davis 1986 foundational framework understanding technology adoption emphasizing perceived ease use peou perceived usefulness pu key determinant intention use itu attitude toward using atu initially central tam later omitted iteration like tam2 utaut paper revisits role atu within tam employing one-step meta-analytic structural equation modelling osmasem analyze educational technology acceptance finding reveal atu significantly mediates relationship peou pu itu enhancing explanatory power tam comparing model without atu tam-o tam-r finding demonstrate incorporating atu provides comprehensive understanding user behavior particularly voluntary use context study underscore importance attitude technology adoption suggests future tam iteration consider atu improve predictive accuracy research contributes theoretical advancement tam offer practical insight enhancing technology acceptance educational setting,watch attitude examining role attitude technology acceptance model meta-analytic structural equation modelling technology acceptance model tam proposed fred davis 1986 foundational framework understanding technology adoption emphasizing perceived ease use peou perceived usefulness pu key determinant intention use itu attitude toward using atu initially central tam later omitted iteration like tam2 utaut paper revisits role atu within tam employing one-step meta-analytic structural equation modelling osmasem analyze educational technology acceptance finding reveal atu significantly mediates relationship peou pu itu enhancing explanatory power tam comparing model without atu tam-o tam-r finding demonstrate incorporating atu provides comprehensive understanding user behavior particularly voluntary use context study underscore importance attitude technology adoption suggests future tam iteration consider atu improve predictive accuracy research contributes theoretical advancement tam offer practical insight enhancing technology acceptance educational setting,4,4_student_learning_language_course

To counteract this, researchers have proposed attack frontrunning protections designed to preempt malicious transactions by inserting""whitehat""transactions ahead of them to protect the assets. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing frontrunning protections have become ineffective in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we collected 158 recent real-world attack transactions and discovered that 141 of them can bypass state-of-the-art frontrunning protections. We systematically analyze these attacks and show how inherent limitations of existing frontrunning techniques hinder them from protecting valuable assets in the real world. We then propose a new approach involving 1) preemptive hijack, and 2) attack backrunning, which circumvent the existing limitations and can help protect assets before and after an attack. Our approach adapts the exploit used in the attack to the same or similar contracts before and after the attack to safeguard the assets. We conceptualize adapting exploits as a program repair problem and apply established techniques to implement our approach into a full-fledged framework, BACKRUNNER.

Malicious website identification using design attribute learning,"Or Naim, Doron Cohen, I. Ben-Gal","Malicious websites pose a challenging cybersecurity threat. Traditional tools for detecting malicious websites rely heavily on industry-specific domain knowledge, are maintained by large-scale research operations, and result in a never-ending attacker–defender dynamic. Malicious websites need to balance two opposing requirements to successfully function: escaping malware detection tools while attracting visitors. This fundamental conflict can be leveraged to create a robust and sustainable detection approach based on the extraction, analysis, and learning of design attributes for malicious website identification. In this paper, we propose a next-generation algorithm for extended design attribute learning that learns and analyzes web page structures, content, appearances, and reputation to detect malicious websites. Results from a large-scale experiment that was conducted on more than 35,000 websites suggest that the proposed algorithm effectively detects more than 83% of all malicious websites while maintaining a low false-positive rate of 2%. In addition, the proposed method can incorporate user feedback and flag new suspicious websites and thus can be effective against zero-day attacks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5a015fe816932af2c0cce6914ed51d9ea1e6f4c,c5a015fe816932af2c0cce6914ed51d9ea1e6f4c,malicious website identification using design attribute learning,"Or Naim, Doron Cohen, I.

Early Attachment Network to Multiple Caregivers: A Brief History of Research and Assessment Models,"Or Dagan, A. Sagi-Schwartz","Early attachment has been commonly hypothesized to predict children’s future developmental outcomes, and robust evidence relying on assessments of single caregiver-child attachment patterns has corroborated this hypothesis. Nevertheless, most often children are raised by multiple caregivers, and they tend to form attachment bonds with more than one of them. In this paper, we briefly describe the conceptual and empirical roots underlying the notion of attachment network to multiple caregivers. We describe potential reasons for researchfocusing on a single caregiver (most often mothers, but recently also fathers) and the historical attempts to establish a more ecologically valid assessment of attachment to multiple caregivers. Finally, we describe a recently developed organizational framework that includes testable models on which future research may rely for assessing the predictive power of attachment networks to multiple caregivers on children’s developmental outcomes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8e969d3e46f042348d33237c6d06732cecfbe7c,c8e969d3e46f042348d33237c6d06732cecfbe7c,early attachment network multiple caregiver brief history research assessment model,"Or Dagan, A.

Effectiveness of routine measurement of health-related quality of life in improving the outcomes of patients with musculoskeletal problems—a cluster randomised controlled trial: protocol paper,"C. Lam, W. Chin, C. Wong, K. Or, D. Fong, J. Cheung, D. Chao, E. Wong, P. Kind","Introduction Managing chronic musculoskeletal problems usually focuses on pain control using medications, but outcomes are often unsatisfactory and sometimes harmful. Information on a patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may trigger a doctor to tailor management improving quality of life. The aim of this trial is to find out whether routine measurement and reporting of a patient’s EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) HRQOL data using an electronic platform can improve HRQOL and pain in patients with chronic knee or back problems in primary care. We will also assess the acceptability of routine electronic measurements and reporting of the EQ-5D-5L in primary care settings. Methods This is a multicentre, prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial set in six public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. At the intervention clinics, subjects will complete an electronic EQ-5D-5L form at recruitment and at each clinic follow-up over 12 months. A report of the patient’s longitudinal EQ-5D-5L data will be provided to the doctor. Subjects in the control clinics will receive care as usual. All subjects will complete the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a 10-point Pain Rating Scale and a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic information and data on morbidity and service utilisation at recruitment at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcome is the change in WOMAC total score. Secondary outcomes are change in pain, other patient-reported outcome scores and doctor-rated severity of disease. Group differences in the changes in WOMAC and other outcome scores over time will be analysed using generalised estimating equation model with an intention-to-treat principle. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (IRB reference number: UW 18-270). The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Colón-Ramos","ABSTRACT In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6737c2627bcad064410a48f8077e3ca455fa0639,6737c2627bcad064410a48f8077e3ca455fa0639,guideline use interpretation assay monitoring autophagy 4th edition 1,"D.

Mitigating Data Injection Attacks on Federated Learning,"O. Shalom, Amir Leshem, W. U. Bajwa","Federated learning is a technique that allows multiple entities to collaboratively train models using their data without compromising data privacy. However, despite its advantages, federated learning can be susceptible to false data injection attacks. In these scenarios, a malicious entity with control over specific agents in the network can manipulate the learning process, leading to a suboptimal model. Consequently, addressing these data injection attacks presents a significant research challenge in federated learning systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect and mitigate data injection attacks on federated learning systems. Our mitigation strategy is a local scheme, performed during a single instance of training by the coordinating node, allowing for mitigation during the convergence of the algorithm. Whenever an agent is suspected of being an attacker, its data will be ignored for a certain period; this decision will often be re-evaluated. We prove that with probability one, after a finite time, all attackers will be ignored while the probability of ignoring a trustful agent becomes zero, provided that there is a majority of truthful agents. Simulations show that when the coordinating node detects and isolates all the attackers, the model recovers and converges to the truthful model.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44e9f1b8405c3f62b0ad7c1d2d08d8ac533e0675,44e9f1b8405c3f62b0ad7c1d2d08d8ac533e0675,mitigating data injection attack federated learning,"O.

Insights into abusive workplace behavior,"Aharon Tziner, Hadara Bar-Mor, Daphna Shwartz-Asher, Or Shkoler, Lilach Geva, Haim Levi","Objectives This paper explores definitions, incidences, and outcomes of workplace abuse – a widespread, worldwide social phenomenon impinging on the well-being of workers in a developing labor market – and possible directions for delineating and standardizing classifications of the phenomenon that facilitate workers’ protection. Furthermore, we employ Tepper’s Abusive Supervision Survey Questionnaire [ASSQ] to identify managerial abuse in organizations regarding the type of organization (public/private), gender of the perpetrator, gender of the target, and the managerial role, of each of the abuse items. Finally, we suggest directions for further research and practical measures designed to facilitate the diminution of behavioral abuse in the workplace in the foreseeable future. Hypotheses No hypotheses are submitted in this exploratory paper. Methods Employees of two large organizations (the Katzrin Local Council and Tigbur Ltd.) and another small national organization in Israel were approached, requesting their assistance in this investigation. We introduced the questionnaire, noting its anonymity and the academic context, and that subject participation was voluntary. The questionnaire consisted of fifteen statements on a five-point response scale ranging from 1 = “I cannot remember him/her ever using this behavior with me” to 5 = “He/she uses this behavior very often with me” (alpha = 0.97, M = 1.81, SD = 1.03). One hundred five respondents comprised the final sample: men (39%) and women (61%) aged 23–66. 66.7% of the respondents were employed in a public organization, 28.5% in a private organization, and 4.8% in a national organization. Years of education: less than 12 (14.3%); 12 full years (17.1%); tertiary education (10.5%); bachelor’s degree (40%); and master’s degree and above (18.1%). While 28.6% held managerial positions, 71.4% did not. Job tenure ranged between 0.5 and 42 years. The participants in national and private organizations were combined to avoid the problem of unbalanced groups. Notably, the gender balance of the managers was men (50.5%) and women (49.5%). To ensure statistical validity, we conducted a factor analysis and performed Pearson correlations to examine the relationships between the general latent variable and the abuse items and their intercorrelations. Additionally, we conducted t-tests for independent samples (with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons: see, for example) to compare (1) the respondent’s gender; (2) manager’s gender; and (3) the managerial role with each of the abuse items, and (4) the type of organization (private/public); including the general abuse variable. Results High, positive, and significant correlations were recorded between each questionnaire item and the total score of abusive behavior. The results ranged from r = 0.92 for the statement, “Puts me down in front of others” (r = 0.92) to r = 0.69 for the statement, “Does not allow me to interact with my co-workers” (r = 0.69). Reported abuse in the respondents’ organizations was relatively low (1.81), while among women managers marginally less than their male equivalents (in absolute value, the mean difference in the mean scores fell between 0.28 and 1.25). Abusive behavior in private organizations was more prevalent than in public concerns. Not surprisingly, workers reported more incidents of abuse than managers: in absolute value, the mean difference between employees and managers fell between 0 and 0.67 in the mean scores. Women reported fewer abusive behavior incidents than men; however, the differences found were insignificant. Conclusion The reports of abusive behaviors were meager. Explanations include: (1) Any instance of alleged workplace abuse can be interpreted variously by different individuals, a function of subjective perceptions and interpretations of objective data informed by several internal and external factors impinging on workers’ wellness at work. (2) The extant “trust gap,” which is part of the pervading culture, mitigates against honest reporting of workplace abuse for fear of reprisals. (3) A single report of behavioral abuse at work may be attributable to the same perpetrator repeating the aggression several times. The lower incidence of reported abuse among female managers could be understood in line with studies that indicate that men display aggression more frequently than women playing out their expected respective stereotypical roles in society. Furthermore, following women reflect more stable personality dispositions and are less likely than men to aggress against others without provocation. In line with these observations, women’s management style projects “an ethics of care,” focusing on interpersonal relations and a greater tendency than male managers toward cooperation, creativity, innovation, and shared decision-making. Because the differences found in all the variables in our investigation investigated were not significant, we cannot conclude that the results indicate a trend. Finally, we assume that appropriate sanctions against perpetrators at the workplace and regulation in public organizations would reduce the incidence of workplace abuse. In a more optimistic vein, we recommend that management and HR personnel initiate positive measures to raise awareness of behavioral abuse and eliminate it from their organizations. They should initiate training workshops, events, and support groups akin to those extant in organizations focused on eliminating racial prejudice and advocating sustainability and wellness in the workplace. Ultimately, the goal is to protect workers’ dignity, the integrity of the organizations, and the welfare of society.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6aff04b9f0c9238b2c458dd5f570482352137bf4,6aff04b9f0c9238b2c458dd5f570482352137bf4,insight abusive workplace behavior,"Aharon Tziner, Hadara Bar, Daphna

GA-USTAR phase 1: Development and flight testing of the baseline upset and stall research aircraft,"Or D. Dantsker, G. Ananda, M. Selig","The General Aviation Upset and Stall Testing Aircraft Research (GA-USTAR) project described in this paper aims to develop a dynamically-scaled, Reynolds number corrected, GA aircraft to provide validation data sets for the stall/upset aerodynamic model development. This paper describes the first of three phases of the GA-USTAR project, where the baseline aircraft was developed such that future modifications could be performed to dynamically-scale and then perform Reynolds number corrections to the aircraft. From the possible GA aircraft radio control models available, a 1/5-scale model Cessna 182 was chosen. The aircraft was first built as a radio control model with modifications being made to support future activities. The aircraft was instrumented with a high-fidelity data acquisition system, which was then used to collect baseline flight characteristics of the aircraft. Extensive flight testing was carried out with flight maneuvers performed according flight simulator qualification standards. A sampling of these maneuvers together with all aircraft state details is presented. These maneuvers included idle decent (gliding), elevator-induced phugoid dynamics, roll rate response, rudder response, stall (clean) with low rate elevator deflections, stall (clean) with high rate elevator deflections, and finally stall (half flaps) with high rate elevator deflections.

"Evaluating the clinical utility of Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Nocardia bronchoalveolar PCRs for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary infections in patients with hematological malignancies","Varshini Gali, Rakan Al-Ghanamah, Katie Finnigan, O. Kalchiem-Dekel, M. Kamboj, Tobias M. Hohl, N. Babady, G. Papanicolaou, Yeon Joo Lee","ABSTRACT Invasive pulmonary infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. A delay in identifying a causative agent may result in late initiation of appropriate treatment and adverse clinical outcomes. We examine the diagnostic utility of PCR-based assays in evaluating invasive pulmonary infections from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Patients with hematological malignancies and HCT recipients who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL from January 2020 to January 2024 for unexplained pulmonary infiltrates and had ≥1 PCR targeting Aspergillus, Mucorales, or Nocardia (Eurofins-Viracor, KS) were reviewed. Testing for microbiology and pathology except BAL PCRs to identify the etiology of pulmonary infiltrate was defined as standard-of-care. Invasive fungal diseases were defined as per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) 2020 guidelines. Pulmonary nocardiosis was defined by a combination of clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic criteria. Of 134 patients, 77 were HCT recipients, and 70% were on antifungal agents. Thirty-two were diagnosed with infection with one of the three target pathogens, including 20 with probable or proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), seven with mucormycosis, and three with nocardiosis. For IPA, 19 were diagnosed by standard-of-care, and one (5%) was solely diagnosed by Aspergillus PCR. Mucorales PCR was positive in three of seven cases of proven mucormycosis, but the cultures were negative in all. All three nocardiosis cases were detected by PCR and culture. In our cohort, PCR targeting Mucorales and Nocardia can improve the early detection of invasive pulmonary infection, whereas Aspergillus PCR has a low added value when done in conjunction with standard-of-care, including BAL galactomannan. IMPORTANCE Invasive pulmonary infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Timely diagnosis of invasive pulmonary infection reduces the time to targeted treatment initiation and improves clinical outcomes. The recent European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) update included the addition of serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PCR as a method to determine probable Aspergillus disease. This reflects an increased utilization of PCR-based assays in the diagnosis of fungal diseases. Although PCR assays for Aspergillus diagnosis have been well characterized in the literature, their additive clinical utility in conjunction with BAL galactomannan index measurements remains unclear. Moreover, only a few reports characterize the analytic and clinical performance of Mucorales and Nocardia PCR.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f57df658df3e51858645d25f21c0c655780fc49,9f57df658df3e51858645d25f21c0c655780fc49,evaluating clinical utility aspergillus mucorales nocardia bronchoalveolar pcrs diagnosis invasive pulmonary infection patient hematological malignancy,"Varshini Gali, Rakan Al, Katie Finnigan, O.

Sifting Through the Haystack - Efficiently Finding Rare Animal Behaviors in Large-Scale Datasets,"Shir Bar, Or Hirschorn, Roi Holzman, S. Avidan","In the study of animal behavior, researchers often record long continuous videos, accumulating into large-scale datasets. However, the behaviors of interest are often rare compared to routine behaviors. This incurs a heavy cost on manual annotation, forcing users to sift through many samples before finding their needles. We propose a pipeline to efficiently sample rare behaviors from large datasets, enabling the creation of training datasets for rare behavior classifiers. Our method only needs an unlabeled animal pose or acceleration dataset as input and makes no assumptions regarding the type, number, or characteristics of the rare behaviors. Our pipeline is based on a recent graph-based anomaly detection model for human behavior, which we apply to this new data domain. It leverages anomaly scores to automatically label normal samples while directing human annotation efforts toward anomalies. In research data, anomalies may come from many different sources (e.g., signal noise versus true rare instances). Hence, the entire labeling budget is focused on the abnormal classes, letting the user review and label samples according to their needs. We tested our approach on three datasets of freely-moving animals, acquired in the laboratory and the field. We found that graph-based models are particularly useful when studying motion-based behaviors in animals, yielding good results while using a small labeling budget. Our method consistently outperformed traditional random sampling, offering an average improvement of 70% in performance and creating datasets even when the behavior of interest was only 0.02% of the data. Even when the performance gain was minor (e.g., when the behavior is not rare), our method still reduced the annotation effort by half11Our code is available at https://github.com/shir3bar/SiftingTheHaystack..",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/219f6db7bf016348dd2330408e0a774a331ae8f2,219f6db7bf016348dd2330408e0a774a331ae8f2,sifting haystack efficiently finding rare animal behavior large-scale datasets,"Shir Bar, Or Hirschorn, Roi Holzman, S.

Facial vs Non-facial Molluscum Contagiosum Infection in Children: A Cross-sectional Study,"Nicolas Andre, Eman Jurban, Adva Alyagon, Chen Moskovich, Or Kaplan, Gidon Test, Amir Horev","Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection affecting different body areas, including the face. Previous data have shown cases of atypical lesions, notably on the face, and it was thought relevant to further examine differences between facial and non-facial lesions. All cases of children (0–18) diagnosed with molluscum contagiosum from 2013–2022 at the paediatric dermatology clinic of Soroka University Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed, and 615 children were included in the study. Facial lesions tended to be found in younger children (p = 0.018). Non-facial lesions were more erythematous (p < 0.001), itchier (p < 0.001), and showed similar patterns of ulceration (p = 0.078) and purulence (p = 0.779). The average lesion diameter was similar in patients with or without facial lesions (p = 1). Children with facial lesions were treated differently from patients without facial lesions (p < 0.001); however, there were no differences in treatment response. This research challenges assumptions concerning the severity of facial lesions, including eyelid lesions, by revealing that, overall, they exhibit less inflammation than non-facial lesions. Despite the potential for greater psychosocial burdens and impacts on self-esteem associated with lesions on the sensitive facial area, this study provides evidence that they are not inherently more worrisome and can be managed similarly to lesions found elsewhere in the body. SIGNIFICANCE Molluscum contagiosum is a prevalent skin infection with distinctive features, but at times it exhibits atypical manifestations, particularly on the face, where the skin differs from the rest of the body. Our study aimed to investigate potential variations in the presentation of molluscum contagiosum infections between facial and non-facial areas. After analysing 615 children, we observed that both facial and non-facial lesions shared similar characteristics regarding inflammation risk and responses to conventional treatments for this condition; thus, they can be managed similarly.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d0de05b6eaa6713d0806e593cf894f50e3697b5,2d0de05b6eaa6713d0806e593cf894f50e3697b5,facial v non-facial molluscum contagiosum infection child cross-sectional study,"Nicolas Andre, Eman Jurban, Adva Alyagon, Chen Moskovich, Or Kaplan, Gidon Test, Amir Horev",molluscum contagiosum common skin infection affecting different body area including face previous data shown case atypical lesion notably face thought relevant examine difference facial non-facial lesion case child 0–18 diagnosed molluscum contagiosum 2013–2022 paediatric dermatology clinic soroka university medical center retrospectively reviewed 615 child included study facial lesion tended found younger child p 0.018 non-facial lesion erythematous p 0.001 itchier p 0.001 showed similar pattern ulceration p 0.078 purulence p 0.779 average lesion diameter similar patient without facial lesion p 1 child facial lesion treated differently patient without facial lesion p 0.001 however difference treatment response research challenge assumption concerning severity facial lesion including eyelid lesion revealing overall exhibit less inflammation non-facial lesion despite potential greater psychosocial burden impact self-esteem associated lesion sensitive facial area study provides evidence inherently worrisome managed similarly lesion found elsewhere body significance molluscum contagiosum prevalent skin infection distinctive feature time exhibit atypical manifestation particularly face skin differs rest body study aimed investigate potential variation presentation molluscum contagiosum infection facial non-facial area analysing 615 child observed facial non-facial lesion shared similar characteristic regarding inflammation risk response conventional treatment condition thus managed similarly,facial v non-facial molluscum contagiosum infection child cross-sectional study molluscum contagiosum common skin infection affecting different body area including face previous data shown case atypical lesion notably face thought relevant examine difference facial non-facial lesion case child 0–18 diagnosed molluscum contagiosum 2013–2022 paediatric dermatology clinic soroka university medical center retrospectively reviewed 615 child included study facial lesion tended found younger child p 0.018 non-facial lesion erythematous p 0.001 itchier p 0.001 showed similar pattern ulceration p 0.078 purulence p 0.779 average lesion diameter similar patient without facial lesion p 1 child facial lesion treated differently patient without facial lesion p 0.001 however difference treatment response research challenge assumption concerning severity facial lesion including eyelid lesion revealing overall exhibit less inflammation non-facial lesion despite potential greater psychosocial burden impact self-esteem associated lesion sensitive facial area study provides evidence inherently worrisome managed similarly lesion found elsewhere body significance molluscum contagiosum prevalent skin infection distinctive feature time exhibit atypical manifestation particularly face skin differs rest body study aimed investigate potential variation presentation molluscum contagiosum infection facial non-facial area analysing 615 child observed facial non-facial lesion shared similar characteristic regarding inflammation risk response conventional treatment condition thus managed similarly,1,1_clinical_treatment_disease_patient

Hauser","The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive MS has led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors and toward a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review, which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell–directed therapeutics in MS, and proposes strategies to optimize the use of existing anti–B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.

Textual Toxicity in Social Media: Understanding the Bangla Toxic Language Expressed in Facebook Comment,Mohammad Mamun Or Rashid,"Social Media is a repository of digital literature including user-generated content. The users of social media are expressing their opinion with diverse mediums such as text, emojis, memes, and also through other visual and textual mediums. A major portion of these media elements could be treated as harmful to others and they are known by many words including Cyberbullying and Toxic Language . The goal of this research paper is to analyze a curated and value-added dataset of toxic language titled ToxLex_bn . It is an exhaustive wordlist that can be used as classifier material to detect toxicity in social media. The toxic language/script used by the Bengali community as cyberbullying, hate speech and moral policing became major trends in social media culture in Bangladesh and West Bengal. The toxicity became so high that the victims has to post as a counter or release explanation video for the haters. Most cases are pointed to women celebrity and their relation, dress, lifestyle are became trolled and toxicity flooded in comments boxes. Not only celebrity bashing but also hates occurred between Hindu Muslims, India-Bangladesh, Two opponents of 1971 and these are very common for virtual conflict in the comment thread. Even many times facebook comment causes sue and legal matters in Bangladesh and thus it requires more study. In this study, a Bangla toxic language dataset has been analyzed which was inputted by the user in Bengali script&language. For this, about 1968 unique bigrams or phrases as wordlists have been analyzed which are derived from 2207590 comments.

Cultural Adaptation: A Mediator between Cultural Intelligence and Academic Performance in a Thai Context,"J. B. D’souza, Warisanan Dechpanprasong, C. Chan, Ruthaikan Ornla-or","Seminal research on cultural intelligence is ubiquitous at an organizational level, albeit research at an educational level, especially in a Thai context is scant. Using a quota sample of 426 students, this quantitative paper gathered data from three subgroups in Bangkok: Thai, Chinese and ASEAN from two educational settings. Cultural Intelligence was measured using the “Four Factor Cultural Intelligence” Scale (CQS) of Ang et al., (2007), constituting 20 items, answered on a 7-point Likert-type scale. To measure sociocultural adjustment, the Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (SCAS-R), of Wilson (2013), constituting 21 items, answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale was used. Psychological adjustment was measured using the Psychological Adjustment Scale of Demes and Geeraert (2013), constituting 10 items, answered on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The relationship between the four dimensions of cultural intelligence to academic performance and the relationship of sociocultural adaptation and psychological adjustment as mediators between cultural intelligence and academic performance was hypothesized. Results of Structural Equation Modeling did not support the prediction of the relationship between the four dimensions of cultural intelligence and academic performance of students. The modification indices of the AMOS program testing the relationship between socio-cultural adaptation and psychological adjustment and academic achievement manifested an indirect relationship of the cultural intelligence on the academic achievement via socio-cultural adaptation.

A cross-sectional sample of Hongkongers was surveyed. Data were collected using a self-administrated bilingual (English and Chinese) online survey. Exploratory factor analysis, linear regression and mediation analysis were conducted to test the research model.FindingsThe findings from 216 Hongkongers reveal that different combinations of the four constructs, namely, perceived behavioral control, attitude, subjective norms, and destination image, share a positive effect on individuals' travel intention to Kenya over the three different time horizons. Travel constraints act as a significant negative mediator on the four constructs in predicting travel intention to Kenya among Hongkongers.Practical implicationsThe results provide useful insight to Kenya's destination marketing organization (DMO) and Hong Kong outbound travel agencies to integrate prominent elements into marketing strategies to arouse travel intention and expand their business prospects, which will also accelerate tourism recovery in the post-pandemic era.Originality/valueBy integrating two extended variables into the TPB model, this study makes a contribution by overcoming the deficiency of the original theory.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8eafc4fa7bb574092fb62e42a26fd856192526de,8eafc4fa7bb574092fb62e42a26fd856192526de,post-covid-19 travel intention kenya hong kong applying extended theory planned behavior etpb,"Monica W.

It is a leading cause of blindness in developed countries and exerts significant psychological, social, and economic impact on both patients and the larger society. While there are numerous pharmacotherapy options, posterior segment noninfectious uveitis remains a significant challenge to treat due to its severity, chronicity, and high recurrence rates. Areas covered The index review highlights the unmet needs of uveitis pharmacotherapy and its research and the shortcomings of existing ocular and systemic therapeutic options for noninfectious uveitis. The more promising novel ocular drug delivery methods and therapeutic targets/drugs are discussed, and evidence from the clinical trials is evaluated. Expert Opinion There has been incredible growth in the number of treatment options available to uveitis patients today, especially with the new generation of biologic drugs. Available evidence suggests that these newer options may be superior to conventional immunosuppressive therapies in terms of efficacy and side effect profiles.

Why should we care? Two experiences in the politics of food and food research,"Agata Bachórz, English-Or English","The aim of this article is to analyse the political aspects of food and their significance as an object of study. The first author of the article has studied Polish society as an insider, while the other author had previously conducted research in other countries and three years ago started exploring Poland and Polish gastronomy, finding himself in the role of outsider. Both scholars have been recently working together. The power relations between the societies and the academic worlds from which they come from turned out to be crucial to the research dynamics and became one of the paper’s key interests. Three main topics provide the structure of the collaborative paper: 1) the question of the authors’ positionality; 2) food as a phenomenon that is intrinsically political, and the legitimacy issues related to its study within academia and to scholars’ engagement outside it; and 3) the power and inequality dimensions of food research. The authors agree that inextricable connection of food and politics has not only an academic or theoretical dimension, but impacts the realities of people’s lives.

The UDC California Division Members Database: Using Spatial Analysis to Shed new Light on the Formation of Civil War Memory in California,Or Rappel-Kroyzer,"The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in California played a pivotal role in advancing the ""Lost Cause"" narrative in the state, including erecting Confederate Memorials. Their activities molded a Californian public perception that aligned more with the Southern viewpoint of the Civil War. Given the substantial influence California holds in U.S. culture and politics, understanding this shift is crucial.

Yan, Or Pui Lai Peggy, Ching Tai Yin Patricia","Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of April 9, 2022, there had been 494,587,638 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6,170,283 deaths reported worldwide. In Hong Kong, in recent outbreak, ~55% of confirmed cases were residential care home (RCH) residents and >800 staff were infected. In 2016, ~15% of people aged ≥80 years were living in residential care homes. Objectives: To assess healthcare worker (HCW) knowledge level and attitudes about PPE use in residential care homes. Methods: This cross-sectional study, included participants who worked in the residential care homes, registered as healthcare workers (HCWs). HCWs who were part-time staff or worked <3 months in the residential care home were excluded. Ethical review approval from the faculty research committee of the university was obtained in January 2022. The Knowledge, Attitude, Practical (KAP) questionnaire was adapted. The questionnaire has 33 items pertaining to knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding PPE. Results: In total, 50 questionnaires were received; 32 respondents (64%) were female and 18 (36%) were male. Nearly half of the participants had completed a high diploma course, and 32% had graduated from secondary school. Using ANOVA, there were no significant differences of education level of participants or participant knowledge level of PPE [F(2,47) = .181; P = .835], attitudes [F(2,47) = 1.995; P = .147] and practice [F(2,47) = .459; P = .635]. The Pearson correlation was used to measure the relationship between knowledge level and PPE practices. Our results indicated a significant difference and moderate correlation between knowledge level and PPE practice among HCWs.

Sequential and layered experiments in a research house included cooking, cleaning, variable occupancy, and window-opening. This paper describes the overall design of HOMEChem and presents preliminary case studies investigating the concentrations of reactive trace gases, aerosol particles, and surface films. Cooking was a large source of VOCs, CO2, NOx, and particles. By number, cooking particles were predominantly in the ultrafine mode. Organic aerosol dominated the submicron mass, and, while variable between meals and throughout the cooking process, was dominated by components of hydrocarbon character and low oxygen content, similar to cooking oil. Air exchange in the house ensured that cooking particles were present for only short periods. During unoccupied background intervals, particle concentrations were lower indoors than outdoors. The cooling coils of the house ventilation system induced cyclic changes in water soluble gases. Even during unoccupied periods, concentrations of many organic trace gases were higher indoors than outdoors, consistent with housing materials being potential sources of these compounds to the outdoor environment. Organic material accumulated on indoor surfaces, and exhibited chemical signatures similar to indoor organic aerosol.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/053cc0209615467a14a8188ec375cccf755b4236,053cc0209615467a14a8188ec375cccf755b4236,overview homechem house observation microbial environmental chemistry,"D.

Excellent scalability is often argued for spin qubits defined by lithography and controlled via electrical signals, based on the success of conventional semiconductor integrated circuits. However, the wiring and interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are completely different from those for classical circuits, as individual direct current, pulsed and in some cases microwave control signals need to be routed from external sources to every qubit. This is further complicated by the requirement that these spin qubits currently operate at temperatures below 100 mK. Here, we review several strategies that are considered to address this crucial challenge in scaling quantum circuits based on electron spin qubits. Key assets of spin qubits include the potential to operate at 1 to 4 K, the high density of quantum dots or donors combined with possibilities to space them apart as needed, the extremely long-spin coherence times, and the rich options for integration with classical electronics based on the same technology.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0875f7bd847f07d9b79a86fbdb8a7e83a4203117,0875f7bd847f07d9b79a86fbdb8a7e83a4203117,interfacing spin qubits quantum dot donors—hot dense coherent,"L.

Are trauma research programs in academic and non-academic centers measured by equal standards? A survey of 137 level I trauma centers in the United States,"Robert M. Madayag, Erica Sercy, G. Berg, K. Banton, M. Carrick, M. Lieser, Allen Tanner, D. Bar-Or","Background American College of Surgeons level I trauma center verification requires an active research program. This study investigated differences in the research programs of academic and non-academic trauma centers. Methods A 28-question survey was administered to ACS-verified level I trauma centers in 11/12/2020–1/7/2021. The survey included questions on center characteristics (patient volume, staff size), peer-reviewed publications, staff and resources dedicated to research, and funding sources. Results The survey had a 31% response rate: 137 invitations were successfully delivered via email, and 42 centers completed at least part of the survey. Responding level I trauma centers included 36 (86%) self-identified academic and 6 (14%) self-identified non-academic centers. Academic and non-academic centers reported similar annual trauma patient volume (2190 vs. 2450), number of beds (545 vs. 440), and years of ACS verification (20 vs. 14), respectively. Academic centers had more full-time trauma surgeons (median 8 vs 6 for non-academic centers) and general surgery residents (median 30 vs 7) than non-academic centers. Non-academic centers more frequently ranked trauma surgery (100% vs. 36% academic), basic science (50% vs. 6% academic), neurosurgery (50% vs. 14% academic), and nursing (33% vs. 0% academic) in the top three types of studies conducted. Academic centers were more likely to report non-profit status (86% academic, 50% non-academic) and utilized research funding from external governmental or non-profit grants more often (76% vs 17%). Conclusions Survey results suggest that academic centers may have more physician, resident, and financial resources available to dedicate to trauma research, which may make fulfillment of ACS level I research requirements easier. Structural and institutional changes at non-academic centers, such as expansion of general surgery resident programs and increased pursuit of external grant funding, may help ensure that academic and non-academic sites are equally equipped to fulfill ACS research criteria.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e9c77da0cf8cee68beb593aa3703781b88b2d1b5,e9c77da0cf8cee68beb593aa3703781b88b2d1b5,trauma research program academic non-academic center measured equal standard survey 137 level trauma center united state,"Robert M.

In the current paper, the impacts of such a leadership style on workers’ turnover intentions (TIs), counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are investigated through a dyadic lens—the mediation of leader-member exchange (LMX). Furthermore, when the workplace atmosphere is also tainted by high level of perceived organizational politics (POP) (as a moderator), these relationships deepen and and/or change (for the worse).

How Does Work Motivation Impact Employees’ Investment at Work and Their Job Engagement? A Moderated-Moderation Perspective Through an International Lens,"Or Shkoler, Takuma Kimura","This paper aims at shedding light on the effects that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, as predictors, have on heavy work investment of time and effort and on job engagement. Using a questionnaire survey, this study conducted a moderated-moderation analysis, considering two conditional effects—worker’s status (working students vs. non-student employees) and country (Israel vs. Japan)—as potential moderators, since there are clear cultural differences between these countries. Data were gathered from 242 Israeli and 171 Japanese participants. The analyses revealed that worker’s status moderates the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on heavy work investment of time and effort and on job engagement and that the moderating effects were conditioned by country differences.

These conditions are associated with a range of autoantibodies which are thought to be triggered by infections, most notably group A streptococci (GAS). Based on animal models using huma sera, these autoantibodies are thought to cross-react with neural antigens in the basal ganglia and modulate neuronal activity and behavior. As is true for many childhood neuroinflammatory diseases and rheumatological diseases, SC, PANS, and PANDAS lack clinically available, rigorous diagnostic biomarkers and randomized clinical trials. In this review article, we outline the accumulating evidence supporting the role neuroinflammation plays in these disorders. We describe work with animal models including patient-derived anti-neuronal autoantibodies, and we outline imaging studies that show alterations in the basal ganglia. In addition, we present research on metabolites, which are helpful in deciphering functional phenotypes, and on the implication of sleep in these disorders.

Early Attachment Network with Mother and Father: An Unsettled Issue,"Or Dagan, A. Sagi-Schwartz","— Infants’ patterns of attachment to their mothers and fathers inﬂuence important developmental outcomes. Studies suggest that infants form discordant attachment patterns to mothers and fathers, and stress the importance of assessing infants’ parental attachment relationships to evaluate their integrative effects on how they function later in life. However, such studies are few, based on small samples, and not well-designed longitudinally. Moreover, mixed results on how infants’ attachment patterns to mothers and fathers affect important developmental outcomes have resulted in theoretical inconsistencies regarding the model that best describes the organization of multiple attachment relationships and their effect on later development. In this article, we review research on the unsettled issue of infants’ network of attachment to mothers and fathers, and propose explanatory models that can be tested empirically; the methods we suggest are more robust and innovative than those that have been used traditionally.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/921432d49f9677247ed0acfa3b8c484f56b5bd41,921432d49f9677247ed0acfa3b8c484f56b5bd41,early attachment network mother father unsettled issue,"Or Dagan, A.

Economic evaluation in patient safety: a literature review of methods,"Bruna Alves de Rezende, Z. Or, L. Com-ruelle, P. Michel","Patient safety practices, targeting organisational changes for improving patient safety, are implemented worldwide but their costs are rarely evaluated. This paper provides a review of the methods used in economic evaluation of such practices. International medical and economics databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications on economic evaluations of patient safety between 2000 and 2010 in English and French. This was complemented by a manual search of the reference lists of relevant papers. Grey literature was excluded. Studies were described using a standardised template and assessed independently by two researchers according to six quality criteria. 33 articles were reviewed that were representative of different patient safety domains, data types and evaluation methods. 18 estimated the economic burden of adverse events, 3 measured the costs of patient safety practices and 12 provided complete economic evaluations. Healthcare-associated infections were the most common subject of evaluation, followed by medication-related errors and all types of adverse events. Of these, 10 were selected that had adequately fulfilled one or several key quality criteria for illustration. This review shows that full cost–benefit/utility evaluations are rarely completed as they are resource intensive and often require unavailable data; some overcome these difficulties by performing stochastic modelling and by using secondary sources. Low methodological transparency can be a problem for building evidence from available economic evaluations. Investing in the economic design and reporting of studies with more emphasis on defining study perspectives, data collection and methodological choices could be helpful for strengthening our knowledge base on practices for improving patient safety.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e92277b6d2e9275b6d1cf4359da244d71384779,1e92277b6d2e9275b6d1cf4359da244d71384779,economic evaluation patient safety literature review method,"Bruna Alves de Rezende, Z.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major cause of clinical antimicrobial therapy failure, and it has become a major public health concern around the world. Increasing the development of multiple antimicrobials has become available for humans and animals with no appropriate guidance. As a result, inappropriate use of antimicrobials has significantly produced antimicrobial resistance. However, an increasing number of infections such as sepsis are untreatable due to this antimicrobial resistance. In either case, life-saving drugs are rendered ineffective in most cases. The actual causes of antimicrobial resistance are complex and versatile. A lack of adequate health services, unoptimized use of antimicrobials in humans and animals, poor water and sanitation systems, wide gaps in access and research and development in healthcare technologies, and environmental pollution have vital impacts on antimicrobial resistance.

"Book review: 《香港, 鬱躁的家邦: 本土觀點的香港源流史》(A national history of Hong Kong)",Nick H. K. Or,"This book provides a unique account of Hong Kong’s history with an explicit political agenda in mind. Eric Tsui purposefully adopts a contentious discourse in response to national education in Hong Kong and patriotism towards the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) promoted by both Chinese and Hong Kong officials in recent years. Tsui has conducted an extensive search of the academic literature on the history of Hong Kong, and he summarizes his research findings systematically in this book. The main argument is that Hong Kong is a unique nation (國族) with an identity that is different from that of mainland China, and the book supports this argument by offering three distinct historical perspectives. Firstly, the earlier inhabitants of Hong Kong were Baiyue (百越), a group of indigenous people who lived in Lingnan, in what is now southern China. Baiyue are different from Han Chinese who constitute the main population of modern China. Secondly, Hong Kong has been heavily influenced by Western culture since the late-Qing dynasty. The Western and Christian ways of thinking liberalized the region and nurtured a set of core values different from those in mainland China. Thirdly, Hong Kong was not involved in the nation-building process of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the first half of the 20th century. In contrast, Hong Kong absorbed a large number of refugees during the Chinese civil war, and these refugees regarded Hong Kong as their home rather than the China ruled by the CCP. The author elaborates each of these three perspectives in the 18 chapters that make up this book. The first three chapters of the book discuss the migration history of Hong Kong’s early settlers in ancient times. It highlights differences between Han Chinese and Baiyue, particularly how those differences made Baiyue resist integrating with Han Chinese. Chapters 4 through 8 explain how Western people, businesses, academics, and missionaries, as well as political institutions, have interacted and integrated with the locals since the late 18th century. This has created a distinct multiracial and multicultural society in Hong Kong.

Proposal of Resilient Housing Features for the Disaster Affected Community of Bangladesh,"G. M. Harun-Or-Rashid, J. Castro, Mithun Chakrabartty, M. Kamruzzaman","Thinking resiliency in terms of housing features for post disaster housing reconstruction (PDHR) is a paramount initiative after a disaster. Therefore, the aim of this research is to ascertain the demands of the disaster victims and propose a wind-resistant, resilient housing prototype that would be affordable. Based on a three-month survey of the region severely damaged by Cyclone SIDR in Bangladesh, this research argues that PDHR’s planning features are significantly short of the victims’ choice, need, and demand, forcing them to quickly modify or transform the reconstructed houses. Based on the survey, a prototype covering an area of 37.21 sq. m (400 sq. ft) with a hybrid construction technique and a cost model are proposed that will be a resilient solution against cyclones and other natural hazards. Additionally, the proposed house was modeled using finite elements, and its findings are within the International Building Code’s allowable limits.

 The nature of dark matter and properties of neutrinos are among the most pressing issues in contemporary particle physics. The dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber is the leading technology to cover the available parameter space for weakly interacting massive particles, while featuring extensive sensitivity to many alternative dark matter candidates. These detectors can also study neutrinos through neutrinoless double-beta decay and through a variety of astrophysical sources. A next-generation xenon-based detector will therefore be a true multi-purpose observatory to significantly advance particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, solar physics, and cosmology.

"Optimal Thermal Unit Commitment for Solving Duck Curve Problem by Introducing CSP, PSH and Demand Response","H. Howlader, Mohammad Masih Sediqi, A. Ibrahimi, T. Senjyu","Nowadays, the installations of photovoltaics (PVs) in the smart grid have been growing dramatically because the price of PVs is falling drastically. Undoubtedly, this is a great achievement for the recent smart grid technology. However, the colossal penetration of PVs’ power at the day-time changes the load demand of thermal generations (TGs) of a smart grid which creates duck shape load curve called duck curve. In a duck curve, peak and off-peak gaps are very large which increase the start-up cost (SUC) of TGs because the units of TGs must be turned ON and turned OFF frequently. Therefore, it is very significant to run TGs units optimally. Only an optimization technique is not enough to bring a good solution. This research considers concentrated solar power and pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH) as the energy storages. Also, fuel cells are considered as the controllable loads in the demand side’s smart houses. In addition, this paper considers the real-time price-based demand response. The optimal unit commitment (UC) of TGs, PSHs, and other generators is introduced for saving the fuel cost and SUC of TGs. The optimal results of the proposed model are determined by using MATLAB® INTLINPROG optimization toolbox. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results have been compared with some other methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f400057bebf3d38af673bce33315fcd3a8e7c9eb,f400057bebf3d38af673bce33315fcd3a8e7c9eb,optimal thermal unit commitment solving duck curve problem introducing csp psh demand response,"H.

Improving Self-Care in Patients With Coexisting Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension by Technological Surrogate Nursing: Randomized Controlled Trial,"C. Or, Kaifeng Liu, M. So, Bernard Cheung, L. Yam, A. Tiwari, Y. F. Lau, Tracy Lau, Pui Sze Grace Hui, H. C. Cheng, Joseph Tan, M. Cheung","Background Technological surrogate nursing (TSN) derives from the idea that nurse-caregiver substitutes can be created by technology to support chronic disease self-care. Objective This paper begins by arguing that TSN is a useful and viable approach to chronic disease self-care. The analysis then focuses on the empirical research question of testing and demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of prototype TSN supplied to patients with the typical complex chronic disease of coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. At the policy level, it is shown that the data allow for a calibration of TSN technology augmentation, which can be readily applied to health care management. Methods A 24-week, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed and implemented among diabetic and hypertensive outpatients in two Hong Kong public hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group, supplied with a tablet-based TSN app prototype, or to a conventional self-managing control group. Primary indices—hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure—and secondary indices were measured at baseline and at 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks after initiation, after which the data were applied to test TSN effectiveness and safety. Results A total of 299 participating patients were randomized to the intervention group (n=151) or the control group (n=148). Statistically significant outcomes that directly indicated TSN effectiveness in terms of hemoglobin 1c were found in both groups but not with regard to systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These findings also offered indirect empirical support for TSN safety. Statistically significant comparative changes in these primary indices were not observed between the groups but were suggestive of an operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation. Statistically significant changes in secondary indices were obtained in one or both groups, but not between the groups. Conclusions The RCT’s strong behavioral basis, as well as the importance of safety and effectiveness when complex chronic illness is proximately self-managed by layperson patients, prompted the formulation of the empirical joint hypothesis that TSN would improve patient self-care while satisfying the condition of patient self-safety. Statistical and decision analysis applied to the experimental outcomes offered support for this hypothesis. Policy relevance of the research is demonstrated by the derivation of a data-grounded operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation with ready application to health care management.

Metabolic Vulnerability in the Neurodegenerative Disease Glaucoma,"D. Inman, M. Harun-Or-Rashid","Axons can be several orders of magnitude longer than neural somas, presenting logistical difficulties in cargo trafficking and structural maintenance. Keeping the axon compartment well supplied with energy also presents a considerable challenge; even seemingly subtle modifications of metabolism can result in functional deficits and degeneration. Axons require a great deal of energy, up to 70% of all energy used by a neuron, just to maintain the resting membrane potential. Axonal energy, in the form of ATP, is generated primarily through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. In addition, glial cells contribute metabolic intermediates to axons at moments of high activity or according to need. Recent evidence suggests energy disruption is an early contributor to pathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by axonopathy. However, the degree to which the energy disruption is intrinsic to the axon vs. associated glia is not clear. This paper will review the role of energy availability and utilization in axon degeneration in glaucoma, a chronic axonopathy of the retinal projection.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3504de35374056bc466aa0c5b63b270176c03ba3,3504de35374056bc466aa0c5b63b270176c03ba3,metabolic vulnerability neurodegenerative disease glaucoma,"D.

"Fluctuating Asymmetry: Methods, Theory, and Applications","J. H. Graham, Shmuel Raz, H. Hel-Or, E. Nevo","Fluctuating asymmetry consists of random deviations from perfect symmetry in populations of organisms. It is a measure of developmental noise, which reflects a population’s average state of adaptation and coadaptation. Moreover, it increases under both environmental and genetic stress, though responses are often inconsistent. Researchers base studies of fluctuating asymmetry upon deviations from bilateral, radial, rotational, dihedral, translational, helical, and fractal symmetries. Here, we review old and new methods of measuring fluctuating asymmetry, including measures of dispersion, landmark methods for shape asymmetry, and continuous symmetry measures. We also review the theory, developmental origins, and applications of fluctuating asymmetry, and attempt to explain conflicting results.

"Combining Associations Between Emotional Intelligence, Work Motivation, and Organizational Justice With Counterproductive Work Behavior: A Profile Analysis via Multidimensional Scaling (PAMS) Approach","Aharon Tziner, Erich C. Fein, Se-Kang Kim, Cristinel Vasiliu, Or Shkoler","The need for better incorporation of the construct emotional intelligence (EI) into counterproductive work behavior (CWB) research may be achieved via a unified conceptual framework. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to use the Profile Analysis via Multidimensional Scaling (PAMS) approach, and a conceptual framework that unifies motivational process with antecedents and outcomes, to assess differences in EI concerning a variety of constructs: organizational justice, CWB, emotional exhaustion, job satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation. Employing established scales within a framework unifying CWB, intrinsic motivation, EI, organizational justice, and outcome constructs, two EI-based profiles displayed associations with CWB based on responses from 3,293 employees. Both the first core profile, high overall justice and low emotional intelligence, and the second core profile, high emotional intelligence and low work motivation, displayed associations with interpersonal deviance and organizational deviance, as well as emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction.

Network Anomaly Detection Using Transfer Learning Based on Auto-Encoders Loss Normalization,"Aviv Yehezkel, Eyal Elyashiv, Or Soffer","Anomaly detection is a classic, long-term research problem. Previous attempts to solve it have used auto-encoders to learn a representation of the normal behaviour of networks and detect anomalies according to reconstruction loss. In this paper, we study the problem of anomaly detection in computer networks and propose the concept of ""auto-encoder losses transfer learning"". This approach normalizes auto-encoder losses in different model deployments, providing the ability to transform loss vectors of different networks with potentially significant varying characteristics, properties, and behaviors into a domain invariant representation. This is forwarded to a global detection model that can detect and classify threats in a generalized way that is agnostic to the specific network deployment, allowing for comprehensive network coverage.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52f0d9afbaf969147f93271ec25b34fdbd299bda,52f0d9afbaf969147f93271ec25b34fdbd299bda,network anomaly detection using transfer learning based auto-encoders loss normalization,"Aviv Yehezkel, Eyal Elyashiv, Or Soffer",anomaly detection classic long-term research problem previous attempt solve used auto-encoders learn representation normal behaviour network detect anomaly according reconstruction loss paper study problem anomaly detection computer network propose concept `` auto-encoder loss transfer learning '' approach normalizes auto-encoder loss different model deployment providing ability transform loss vector different network potentially significant varying characteristic property behavior domain invariant representation forwarded global detection model detect classify threat generalized way agnostic specific network deployment allowing comprehensive network coverage,network anomaly detection using transfer learning based auto-encoders loss normalization anomaly detection classic long-term research problem previous attempt solve used auto-encoders learn representation normal behaviour network detect anomaly according reconstruction loss paper study problem anomaly detection computer network propose concept `` auto-encoder loss transfer learning '' approach normalizes auto-encoder loss different model deployment providing ability transform loss vector different network potentially significant varying characteristic property behavior domain invariant representation forwarded global detection model detect classify threat generalized way agnostic specific network deployment allowing comprehensive network coverage,-1,-1_research_study_paper_analysis
"Heavy-Work Investment, Its Organizational Outcomes and Conditional Factors: A Contemporary Perspective over a Decade of Literature","Edna Rabenu, Or Shkoler","The construct of heavy-work investment (HWI) is bi-dimensional, revolving around the investment of both time and effort at work. The current paper expands the research thinking and joins the pioneering studies that explore HWI as a relatively new concept in the work-related literature (since 2012). The prime aim of this conceptual paper is to develop a model regarding the intricate relationships between the dimensions of HWI and their work outcomes (with emphasis on possible conditional factors). In particular: (1) we refine the definition of HWI by accounting for the different levels of time and effort investment and (2) we outline multiplex propositions with regard to possible (positive and negative) outcomes of HWI, considering different moderators that can potentially impact these associations. Finally, we offer practical implications for human resource management.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64edd34bbada4ab0dd60066768645ab1711e52a2,64edd34bbada4ab0dd60066768645ab1711e52a2,heavy-work investment organizational outcome conditional factor contemporary perspective decade literature,"Edna Rabenu, Or Shkoler",construct heavy-work investment hwi bi-dimensional revolving around investment time effort work current paper expands research thinking join pioneering study explore hwi relatively new concept work-related literature since 2012 prime aim conceptual paper develop model regarding intricate relationship dimension hwi work outcome emphasis possible conditional factor particular 1 refine definition hwi accounting different level time effort investment 2 outline multiplex proposition regard possible positive negative outcome hwi considering different moderator potentially impact association finally offer practical implication human resource management,heavy-work investment organizational outcome conditional factor contemporary perspective decade literature construct heavy-work investment hwi bi-dimensional revolving around investment time effort work current paper expands research thinking join pioneering study explore hwi relatively new concept work-related literature since 2012 prime aim conceptual paper develop model regarding intricate relationship dimension hwi work outcome emphasis possible conditional factor particular 1 refine definition hwi accounting different level time effort investment 2 outline multiplex proposition regard possible positive negative outcome hwi considering different moderator potentially impact association finally offer practical implication human resource management,5,5_employee_work_organizational_organization
iMagLS: Interaural Level Difference with Magnitude Least-Squares Loss for Optimized First-Order Head-Related Transfer Function,"Or Berebi, Zamir Ben-Hur, D. Alon, B. Rafaely","Binaural reproduction for headphone-based listening is an active research area due to its widespread use in evolving technologies such as augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR). On the one hand, these applications demand high quality spatial audio perception to preserve the sense of immersion. On the other hand, recording devices may only have a few microphones, leading to low-order representations such as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). However, first-order Ambisonics leads to limited externalization and spatial resolution. In this paper, a novel head-related transfer function (HRTF) preprocessing optimization loss is proposed, and is minimized using nonlinear programming. The new method, denoted iMagLS, involves the introduction of an interaural level difference (ILD) error term to the now widely used MagLS optimization loss for the lateral plane angles. Results indicate that the ILD error could be substantially reduced, while the HRTF magnitude error remains similar to that obtained with MagLS. These results could prove beneficial to the overall spatial quality of first-order Ambisonics, while other reproduction methods could also benefit from considering this modified loss.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f811ad1426df73341918cba22825cbc6466abb1,8f811ad1426df73341918cba22825cbc6466abb1,imagls interaural level difference magnitude least-squares loss optimized first-order head-related transfer function,"Or Berebi, Zamir Ben, D.

Face Recognition Under Adverse Viewing Conditions: Implications for Eyewitness Testimony,"Charles C.-F. Or, Denise Y. Lim, Siyuan Chen, A. L. Lee","Eyewitness testimony forms an important component in deciding whether a case can be prosecuted. Yet, many criminal perpetrators deliberately conceal their faces with disguises or under dim lighting, undermining eyewitness accuracy. This article reviews recent studies to characterize the factors that impair face recognition performance, specifically, various forms of face disguise (e.g., face masks, sunglasses) and different lighting conditions. Research shows that identification accuracy, alongside eyewitness confidence and decision bias, all affect the reliability of eyewitness accounts. A consistent finding across studies is that face-identification accuracy can be improved by matching the viewing conditions during the police lineup with those during the crime (e.g., showing masked faces during the lineup should the perpetrator be masked). Current face recognition research provides specific recommendations for optimizing the procedures in eyewitness testimony.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44977d65b4cea7aed449372971ef6050d6fb78a2,44977d65b4cea7aed449372971ef6050d6fb78a2,face recognition adverse viewing condition implication eyewitness testimony,"Charles C., Denise Y.

The identification of such concepts is a challenging prediction task that would help multiple parties—including researchers and the general public—focus their attention within the vast scientific literature. In this paper we present a system that predicts the future impact of a scientific concept, represented as a technical term, based on the information available from recently published research articles. We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived from the full text of the articles through a variety of approaches, including rhetorical sentence analysis, information extraction, and time‐series analysis. The results from two large‐scale experiments with 3.8 million full‐text articles and 48 million metadata records support the conclusion that full‐text features are significantly more useful for prediction than metadata‐only features and that the most accurate predictions result from combining the metadata and full‐text features.

Creating and chaining camera moves for quadrotor videography,"Ke Xie, Hao Yang, Shengqiu Huang, Dani Lischinski, M. Christie, Kai Xu, Minglun Gong, D. Cohen-Or, Hui Huang","Capturing aerial videos with a quadrotor-mounted camera is a challenging creative task, as it requires the simultaneous control of the quadrotor's motion and the mounted camera's orientation. Letting the drone follow a pre-planned trajectory is a much more appealing option, and recent research has proposed a number of tools designed to automate the generation of feasible camera motion plans; however, these tools typically require the user to specify and edit the camera path, for example by providing a complete and ordered sequence of key viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a higher level tool designed to enable even novice users to easily capture compelling aerial videos of large-scale outdoor scenes. Using a coarse 2.5D model of a scene, the user is only expected to specify starting and ending viewpoints and designate a set of landmarks, with or without a particular order. Our system automatically generates a diverse set of candidate local camera moves for observing each landmark, which are collision-free, smooth, and adapted to the shape of the landmark. These moves are guided by a landmark-centric view quality field, which combines visual interest and frame composition. An optimal global camera trajectory is then constructed that chains together a sequence of local camera moves, by choosing one move for each landmark and connecting them with suitable transition trajectories. This task is formulated and solved as an instance of the Set Traveling Salesman Problem.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ec337575d4bc3e74f254054c2632cae7fc83d33,4ec337575d4bc3e74f254054c2632cae7fc83d33,creating chaining camera move quadrotor videography,"Ke Xie, Hao Yang, Shengqiu Huang, Dani Lischinski, M.

Several studies showed that among the various natural marine sources of antioxidants, seaweeds have become a potential source of antioxidants because of their bioactive compounds. Most of the metabolic diseases are caused by oxidative stress. It is very well known that antioxidants have a pivotal role in the treatment of those diseases. Recent researches have revealed the potential activity of seaweeds as complementary medicine, which have therapeutic properties for health and disease management. Among the seaweeds, brown seaweeds (Phaeophyta) and their derived bioactive substances showed excellent antioxidant properties than other seaweeds. This review focuses on brown seaweeds and their derived major bioactive compounds such as sulfated polysaccharide, polyphenol, carotenoid, and sterol antioxidant effects and molecular mechanisms in the case of the oxidative stress-originated disease. Antioxidants have a potential role in the modification of stress-induced signaling pathways along with the activation of the oxidative defensive pathways.

Measuring capacities and protecting communities: strengthening regional resilience in the flooded industrial area in Thailand,"T. Nakasu, Ruttiya Bula-Or, Sutee Anantsuksomsri, Sutpratana Duangkaew, Kullachart Prathumchai, Korrakot Positlimpakul, A. Kawasaki","
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to measure the capacities and identify the vulnerabilities of the communities to contribute to their flood disaster risk management.


Design/methodology/approach
Questionnaire-style surveys and interviews in the four target communities and 25 critical facilities have been used. Their flood experience is also collected to explore the practical risk management solutions and preserve those as their local assets.


Findings
Findings show the capacity gaps among the target communities. For instance, the relatively populated urbanized communities tend to have high capacities. On the other hand, the not-so-populated farmer-based communities have low capacities, tending to focus more on droughts than floods, and lack scientific information. This research also identifies vulnerability groups and critical facility locations on the map with narratives.


Originality/value
The findings enable the communities to clarify their updated capacities, examine the vulnerabilities, identify the risks with possible hazard information and guide them to cope with flood risk to protect them with self, mutual and public help. This study can contribute to other industrial parks/estates in Thailand and anywhere in the world as an insightful reference to build resilient industrial complex areas.

Performance Enhancement of the Refrigeration System by Adding Capacitor and Replacing Refrigerant- Experimental Study,"Dr. Mohammad Harun-Or-Rashid, Mohammad Ishtiak Ashraf, Md. Shayel Khan","Manufacturing process and performance analysis of a non-frost refrigeration system are presented in this paper. Main objectives of this research were to suggest better refrigerant as well as propose a technique for further reduction of the power consumption of the system. Performance of the refrigeration system was evaluated for Tetra-fluoro-ethane and Isobutene refrigerant. From the experiment, it is found that, coefficient of performance of the system with Isobutene is better than the coefficient of performance with Tetra-fluoro-ethane. Not only that, Tetra-fluoro-ethane is higher global warming refrigerant than Isobutene. In addition, in this paper, it is shown that, if capacitor is added to the electric circuit then power consumption of the system is dramatically decreased. To reduce the power consumption of the system, capacitors of different micro-farad were added and optimum one was selected through experiment. Maximum coefficient of performance was found for Isobutene with 10μF capacitor. In case of Isobutene, 47.736% energy was saved. Hence, it is proposed to add a capacitor to the circuit and use Isobutene rather than Tetra-fluoro-ethane as refrigerant for better performance of the system.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7074fa6f3e3f5733bfa7bd3d5b7cfe16496b3482,7074fa6f3e3f5733bfa7bd3d5b7cfe16496b3482,performance enhancement refrigeration system adding capacitor replacing refrigerant- experimental study,"Dr. Mohammad Harun, Mohammad Ishtiak Ashraf, Md.

Capturing Distalization,"R. Stamp, Lilyana Khatib, H. Hel-Or","Coding and analyzing large amounts of video data is a challenge for sign language researchers, who traditionally code 2D video data manually. In recent years, the implementation of 3D motion capture technology as a means of automatically tracking movement in sign language data has been an important step forward. Several studies show that motion capture technologies can measure sign language movement parameters – such as volume, speed, variance – with high accuracy and objectivity. In this paper, using motion capture technology and machine learning, we attempt to automatically measure a more complex feature in sign language known as distalization. In general, distalized signs use the joints further from the torso (such as the wrist), however, the measure is relative and therefore distalization is not straightforward to measure. The development of a reliable and automatic measure of distalization using motion tracking technology is of special interest in many fields of sign language research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/332a7ee9e4ece1251a81870da2f2b5a93a417394,332a7ee9e4ece1251a81870da2f2b5a93a417394,capturing distalization,"R.

Larsbo, E. Lewan, D. Or, D. Parsons, N. Parvin, Astrid Taylor, H. Vereecken, N. Jarvis","Soil degradation is a worsening global phenomenon driven by socio‐economic pressures, poor land management practices and climate change. A deterioration of soil structure at timescales ranging from seconds to centuries is implicated in most forms of soil degradation including the depletion of nutrients and organic matter, erosion and compaction. New soil–crop models that could account for soil structure dynamics at decadal to centennial timescales would provide insights into the relative importance of the various underlying physical (e.g. tillage, traffic compaction, swell/shrink and freeze/thaw) and biological (e.g. plant root growth, soil microbial and faunal activity) mechanisms, their impacts on soil hydrological processes and plant growth, as well as the relevant timescales of soil degradation and recovery. However, the development of such a model remains a challenge due to the enormous complexity of the interactions in the soil–plant system. In this paper, we focus on the impacts of biological processes on soil structure dynamics, especially the growth of plant roots and the activity of soil fauna and microorganisms. We first define what we mean by soil structure and then review current understanding of how these biological agents impact soil structure. We then develop a new framework for modelling soil structure dynamics, which is designed to be compatible with soil–crop models that operate at the soil profile scale and for long temporal scales (i.e. decades, centuries). We illustrate the modelling concept with a case study on the role of root growth and earthworm bioturbation in restoring the structure of a severely compacted soil.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dae406a97e1f6b3a1fe2d8500de5e5213a8b5fae,dae406a97e1f6b3a1fe2d8500de5e5213a8b5fae,framework modelling soil structure dynamic induced biological activity,"K.

2D Materials for All‐Solid‐State Lithium Batteries,"Qianyi Ma, Yun Zheng, Dan Luo, Tyler Or, Yizhou Liu, Leixin Yang, Haozhen Dou, Jie-Xia Liang, Y. Nie, Xin Wang, A. Yu, Zhongwei Chen","Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium‐ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all‐solid‐state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity.

Natural Language Processing for Achieving Sustainable Development: The Case of Neural Labelling to Enhance Community Profiling,"Costanza Conforti, Stephanie Hirmer, David Morgan, Marco Basaldella, Yau Ben Or","In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence - and especially Machine Learning - to the field of Sustainable Development (SD). However, until now, NLP has not been applied in this context. In this research paper, we show the high potential of NLP applications to enhance the sustainability of projects. In particular, we focus on the case of community profiling in developing countries, where, in contrast to the developed world, a notable data gap exists. In this context, NLP could help to address the cost and time barrier of structuring qualitative data that prohibits its widespread use and associated benefits. We propose the new task of Automatic UPV classification, which is an extreme multi-class multi-label classification problem. We release Stories2Insights, an expert-annotated dataset, provide a detailed corpus analysis, and implement a number of strong neural baselines to address the task.

Coordinates for instant image cloning,"Zeev Farbman, Gil Hoffer, Y. Lipman, D. Cohen-Or, Dani Lischinski","Seamless cloning of a source image patch into a target image is an important and useful image editing operation, which has received considerable research attention in recent years. This operation is typically carried out by solving a Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which smoothly interpolates the discrepancies between the boundary of the source patch and the target across the entire cloned area. In this paper we introduce an alternative, coordinate-based approach, where rather than solving a large linear system to perform the aforementioned interpolation, the value of the interpolant at each interior pixel is given by a weighted combination of values along the boundary. More specifically, our approach is based on Mean-Value Coordinates (MVC). The use of coordinates is advantageous in terms of speed, ease of implementation, small memory footprint, and parallelizability, enabling real-time cloning of large regions, and interactive cloning of video streams. We demonstrate a number of applications and extensions of the coordinate-based framework.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38530fd134fb5a2564fc694bca657f40cf94585d,38530fd134fb5a2564fc694bca657f40cf94585d,coordinate instant image cloning,"Zeev Farbman, Gil Hoffer, Y.

"Cannabis, the Endocannabinoid System and Immunity—the Journey from the Bedside to the Bench and Back","O. Almogi-Hazan, R. Or","The Cannabis plant contains numerous components, including cannabinoids and other active molecules. The phyto-cannabinoid activity is mediated by the endocannabinoid system. Cannabinoids affect the nervous system and play significant roles in the regulation of the immune system. While Cannabis is not yet registered as a drug, the potential of cannabinoid-based medicines for the treatment of various conditions has led many countries to authorize their clinical use. However, the data from basic and medical research dedicated to medical Cannabis is currently limited. A variety of pathological conditions involve dysregulation of the immune system. For example, in cancer, immune surveillance and cancer immuno-editing result in immune tolerance. On the other hand, in autoimmune diseases increased immune activity causes tissue damage. Immuno-modulating therapies can regulate the immune system and therefore the immune-regulatory properties of cannabinoids, suggest their use in the therapy of immune related disorders. In this contemporary review, we discuss the roles of the endocannabinoid system in immunity and explore the emerging data about the effects of cannabinoids on the immune response in different pathologies.

Association of hypoxia inducible factor 1-Alpha gene polymorphisms with multiple disease risks: A comprehensive meta-analysis,"Md Harun-Or-Roshid, Md Borqat Ali, Jesmin, Md. Nurul Haque Mollah","HIF1A gene polymorphisms have been confirmed the association with cancer risk through the statistical meta-analysis based on single genetic association (SGA) studies. A good number SGA studies also investigated the association of HIF1A gene with several other diseases, but no researcher yet performed statistical meta-analysis to confirm this association more accurately. Therefore, in this paper, we performed a statistical meta-analysis to draw a consensus decision about the association of HIF1A gene polymorphisms with several diseases except cancers giving the weight on large sample size. This meta-analysis was performed based on 41 SGA study’s findings, where the polymorphisms rs11549465 (1772 C/T) and rs11549467 (1790 G/A) of HIF1A gene were analyzed based on 11544 and 7426 cases and 11494 and 7063 control samples, respectively. Our results showed that the 1772 C/T polymorphism is not significantly associated with overall disease risks. The 1790 G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with overall diseases under recessive model (AA vs. AG + GG), which indicates that the A allele is responsible for overall diseases though it is recessive. The subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed the significant association of 1772 C/T polymorphism with overall disease for Caucasian population under the all genetic models, which indicates that the C allele controls overall diseases. The ethnicity subgroup showed the significant association of 1790 G/A polymorphism with overall disease for Asian population under the recessive model (AA vs. AG + GG), which indicates that the A allele is responsible for overall diseases. The subgroup analysis based on disease types showed that 1772 C/T is significantly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) under two genetic models (C vs. T and CC vs. CT + TT), skin disease under two genetic models (CC vs. TT and CC + CT vs. TT), and diabetic complications under three genetic models (C vs. T, CT vs. TT and CC + CT vs. TT), where C allele is high risk factor for skin disease and diabetic complications (since, ORs > 1), but low risk factor for COPD (since, ORs < 1). Also the 1790 G/A variant significantly associated with the subgroup of cardiovascular disease (CVD) under homozygote model, diabetic complications under allelic and homozygote models, and other disease under four genetic models, where the A is high risk factor for diabetic complications and low risk factor for CVD. Thus, this study provided more evidence that the HIF1A gene is significantly associated with COPD, CVD, skin disease and diabetic complications. These might be the severe comorbidities and risk factors for multiple cancers due to the effect of HIF1A gene and need further investigations accumulating large number of studies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cbb772bbd7c4f96039c61941c5f88366ca626e6,7cbb772bbd7c4f96039c61941c5f88366ca626e6,association hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha gene polymorphism multiple disease risk comprehensive meta-analysis,"Md Harun, Md Borqat Ali, Jesmin, Md.

Much.Matter.in.Motion: learning by modeling systems in chemistry and physics with a universal programing platform,"Janan Saba, H. Hel-Or, S. Levy","ABSTRACT This paper presents the design and initial learning research with the MMM modeling platform, seeking to advance middle school students’ learning through constructing computational models of complex physical and chemical systems. A complexity-based structure of an MMM interface is introduced. It suggests that a complex system can be described and modeled by defining entities, their actions, interactions with each other, and interactions with their environment. MMM applies to a wide range of phenomena, targeting learning transfer and generalization. Design principles of MMM are presented and discussed based on a study with seventh-grade students. The study is a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest control-comparison-group design. Findings from a quantitative analysis of the questionnaires show that engaging students with the construction of models using MMM significantly promoted students’ conceptual learning and enhanced their systems’ thinking compared with a comparison group who followed a normative curriculum. Students’ responses to the worksheets showed mutual effects between improving the practice of modeling and promoting conceptual understanding and systems thinking. A qualitative analysis of screen-capture movies of one pair of students and their log files revealed that, in a later construction activity, their constructed models grew in sophistication and they articulated their thinking and learning in depth, using more sophisticated relationships between concepts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efcc66b79dffbd7c184d823d1d262c1837aaf40d,efcc66b79dffbd7c184d823d1d262c1837aaf40d,much.matter.in.motion learning modeling system chemistry physic universal programing platform,"Janan Saba, H.

For neurological disorders, this includes neurodegeneration and inflammation. Scalable imaging technology for big data in neurology is optical coherence tomography (OCT). We highlight that OCT changes observed in the retina, as a window to the brain, are small, requiring rigorous quality control pipelines. There are existing tools for this purpose. Firstly, there are human‐led validated consensus quality control criteria (OSCAR‐IB) for OCT. Secondly, these criteria are embedded into OCT reporting guidelines (APOSTEL). The use of the described annotation of failed OCT scans advances machine learning. This is illustrated through the present review of the advantages and disadvantages of AI‐based applications to OCT data. The neurological conditions reviewed here for the use of big data include Alzheimer disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease, and epilepsy. It is noted that while big data is relevant for AI, ownership is complex. For this reason, we also reached out to involve representatives from patient organizations and the public domain in addition to clinical and research centers. The evidence reviewed can be grouped in a five‐point expansion of the OSCAR‐IB criteria to embrace AI (OSCAR‐AI).

Integrating competing conceptions of risk: A call for future direction of research,"A. Ben–Ari, Keren Or-Chen","The goal of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework that integrates between what has been traditionally presented in the risk literature as two opposing perspectives: the positivist‐probabilistic and the contextualist. Acknowledging the differences between the two, we argue that a reconciliation of both could deepen and expand our understanding of risk, enlarge the scope and utilization of research methodologies, and bridge the gap between lay people's and experts' conceptions of risk. This line of thinking reflects a dialectical approach in suggesting integration (‘synthesis’), while acknowledging the existence of differences and oppositions (‘antitheses’). In 1986, Bruner's conceptualization of two irreducible, and at the same time, possibly integrated modes of thought can serve as a promising direction for researching risk. We further suggest how this line of thinking can be integrated utilizing the mixed‐method design in the study of risk. We claim that the positivist‐probabilistic and contextualist perspectives represent two different approaches to understanding and studying risk, and that any attempt to reduce or ignore one at the expense of the other would result in a limited understanding of the phenomenon.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5a1fddab8f968a548bad650a0a1c88a69d192ec,f5a1fddab8f968a548bad650a0a1c88a69d192ec,integrating competing conception risk call future direction research,"A.

On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements (Extended Abstract),"Haggai Maron, O. Litany, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya","Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, recently attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric Elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions, and that these networks are strictly more expressive than Siamese networks. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point clouds.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d355ec1053cf0c0c33156fa37a053e73d740878,5d355ec1053cf0c0c33156fa37a053e73d740878,learning set symmetric element extended abstract,"Haggai Maron, O.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Study,"O. Cohen-Inbar, O. Cohen-Inbar, R. Starke, Cheng-chia Lee, H. Kano, P. Huang, D. Kondziolka, I. Grills, Danilo Silva, Mahmoud Abbassy, S. Missios, G. Barnett, L. Lunsford, J. Sheehan","BACKGROUND
The management of brainstem arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is a formidable challenge. bAVMs harbor higher morbidity and mortality compared to other locations.


OBJECTIVE
To review the outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of bAVMs in a multicenter study.


METHODS
Six medical centers contributed data from 205 patients through the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Median age was 32 yr (6-81). Median nidus volume was 1.4 mL (0.1-69 mL). Favorable outcome (FO) was defined as AVM obliteration and no post-treatment hemorrhage or permanent symptomatic radiation-induced complications.


RESULTS
Overall obliteration was reported in 65.4% (n = 134) at a mean follow-up of 69 mo. Obliteration was angiographically proven in 53.2% (n = 109) and on MRA in 12.2% (n = 25). Actuarial rate of obliteration at 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 yr after SRS was 24.5%, 43.3%, 62.3%, 73%, and 81.8% respectively. Patients treated with a margin dose >20 Gy were more likely to achieve obliteration (P = .001). Obliteration occurred earlier in patients who received a higher prescribed margin dose (P = .05) and maximum dose (P = .041). Post-SRS hemorrhage occurred in 8.8% (n = 18). Annual postgamma knife latency period hemorrhage was 1.5%. Radiation-induced complications were radiologically evident in 35.6% (n = 73), symptomatic in 14.6% (n = 30), and permanent in 14.6% (n = 30, which included long-tract signs and new cranial nerve deficits). FO was achieved in 64.4% (n = 132). Predictors of an FO were a higher Virginia radiosurgery AVM scale score (P = .003), prior hemorrhage (P = .045), and a lower prescribed maximum dose (P = .006).


CONCLUSION
SRS for bAVMs results in obliteration and avoids permanent complications in the majority of patients.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80019a5f5c1ac7f75dfd4acda4d1ebba4ad05ec2,80019a5f5c1ac7f75dfd4acda4d1ebba4ad05ec2,stereotactic radiosurgery brainstem arteriovenous malformation multicenter study,"O.

Helical Klinotactic Locomotion of Two‐Link Nanoswimmers with Dual‐Function Drug‐Loaded Soft Polysaccharide Hinges,"Jiaen Wu, Bumjin Jang, Y. Harduf, Zvi Chapnik, Ömer Bartu Avci, Xiangzhong Chen, J. Puigmartí‐Luis, O. Ergeneman, B. Nelson, Y. Or, S. Pané","Inspired by the movement of bacteria and other microorganisms, researchers have developed artificial helical micro‐ and nanorobots that can perform corkscrew locomotion or helical path swimming under external energy actuation. In this paper, for the first time the locomotion of nonhelical multifunctional nanorobots that can swim in helical klinotactic trajectories, similarly to rod‐shaped bacteria, under rotating magnetic fields is investigated. These nanorobots consist of a rigid ferromagnetic nickel head connected to a rhodium tail by a flexible hydrogel‐based hollow hinge composed of chemically responsive chitosan and alginate multilayers. This design allows nanoswimmers switching between different dynamic behaviors—from in‐plane tumbling to helical klinotactic swimming—by varying the rotating magnetic field frequency and strength. It also adds a rich spectrum of swimming capabilities that can be adjusted by varying the type of applied magnetic fields and/or frequencies. A theoretical model is developed to analyze the propulsion mechanisms and predict the swimming behavior at distinct rotating magnetic frequencies. The model shows good agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the biomedical capabilities of the nanoswimmers as drug delivery platforms are demonstrated.

Revisiting the Properties of Money,"Isaiah Hull, Or Sattath","The properties of money commonly referenced in the economics literature were originally identified by Jevons (1876) and Menger (1892) in the late 1800s and were intended to describe physical currencies, such as commodity money, metallic coins, and paper bills. In the digital era, many non-physical currencies have either entered circulation or are under development, including demand deposits, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), in-game currencies, and quantum money. These forms of money have novel properties that have not been studied extensively within the economics literature, but may be important determinants of the monetary equilibrium that emerges in the forthcoming era of heightened currency competition. This paper makes the first exhaustive attempt to identify and define the properties of all physical and digital forms of money.

Accelerating Recursive Partition-Based Causal Structure Learning,"Md. Musfiqur Rahman, A. Rasheed, Md. Mosaddek Khan, Mohammad Ali Javidian, Pooyan Jamshidi, Md. Mamun-Or-Rashid","Causal structure discovery from observational data is fundamental to the causal understanding of autonomous systems such as medical decision support systems, advertising campaigns and self-driving cars. This is essential to solve well-known causal decision making and prediction problems associated with those real-world applications. Recently, recursive causal discovery algorithms have gained particular attention among the research community due to their ability to provide good results by using Conditional Independent (CI) tests in smaller sub-problems. However, each of such algorithms needs a refinement function to remove undesired causal relations of the discovered graphs. Notably, with the increase of the problem size, the computation cost (i.e., the number of CI-tests) of the refinement function makes an algorithm expensive to deploy in practice. This paper proposes a generic causal structure refinement strategy that can locate the undesired relations with a small number of CI-tests, thus speeding up the algorithm for large and complex problems. We theoretically prove the correctness of our algorithm. We then empirically evaluate its performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and completion time in synthetic and real datasets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1f7d991407ec325c20e4f4527144f33f952d06b,e1f7d991407ec325c20e4f4527144f33f952d06b,accelerating recursive partition-based causal structure learning,"Md.

Usability Study of a Computer-Based Self-Management System for Older Adults with Chronic Diseases,"C. Or, D. Tao","Background Usability can influence patients’ acceptance and adoption of a health information technology. However, little research has been conducted to study the usability of a self-management health care system, especially one geared toward elderly patients. Objective This usability study evaluated a new computer-based self-management system interface for older adults with chronic diseases, using a paper prototype approach. Methods Fifty older adults with different chronic diseases participated. Two usability evaluation methods were involved: (1) a heuristics evaluation and (2) end-user testing with a think-aloud testing method, audio recording, videotaping, and interviewing. A set of usability metrics was employed to determine the overall system usability, including task incompletion rate, task completion time, frequency of error, frequency of help, satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Interviews were used to elicit participants’ comments on the system design. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the qualitative data were analyzed for content. Results The participants were able to perform the predesigned self-management tasks with the current system design and they expressed mostly positive responses about the perceived usability measures regarding the system interface. However, the heuristics evaluation, performance measures, and interviews revealed a number of usability problems related to system navigation, information search and interpretation, information presentation, and readability. Design recommendations for further system interface modifications were discussed. Conclusions This study verified the usability of the self-management system developed for older adults with chronic diseases. Also, we demonstrated that our usability evaluation approach could be used to quickly and effectively identify usability problems in a health care information system at an early stage of the system development process using a paper prototype.

Strategies for Scaleable Communication and Coordination in Multi-Agent (UAV) Systems,"Jonathan Ponniah, Or D. Dantsker","A system is considered in which agents (UAVs) must cooperatively discover interest-points (i.e., burning trees, geographical features) evolving over a grid. The objective is to locate as many interest-points as possible in the shortest possible time frame. There are two main problems: a control problem, where agents must collectively determine the optimal action, and a communication problem, where agents must share their local states and infer a common global state. Both problems become intractable when the number of agents is large. This survey/concept paper curates a broad selection of work in the literature pointing to a possible solution; a unified control/communication architecture within the framework of reinforcement learning. Two components of this architecture are locally interactive structure in the state-space, and hierarchical multi-level clustering for system-wide communication. The former mitigates the complexity of the control problem and the latter adapts to fundamental throughput constraints in wireless networks. The challenges of applying reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems are discussed. The role of clustering is explored in multi-agent communication.

Research Note - Quantity Discounts in Differentiated Consumer Product Markets,"Ramanathan Subramaniam, Esther Gal‐Or","In this paper, we extend the standard Hotelling model of product differentiation to incorporate a second dimension of consumer heterogeneity that relates to the quantity of the product consumers wish to buy. This extension allows us to derive optimal nonlinear pricing rules chosen by competing sellers when offering differentiated products in the marketplace. It also permits us to assess whether sellers find it optimal to offer quantity discounts in such a setting, and the implications of such discounts on their profitability. We find that offering quantity discounts corresponds, indeed, to equilibrium behavior. The extent of discounting declines the less differentiated the products. Surprisingly, when sellers offer to consumers a choice between two different-sized packages, their profits are, at most, as high as when such a choice is unavailable. Moreover, when utilizing nonlinear pricing rules is not feasible, the profits of the sellers actually decline when they offer consumers a choice between different-sized packages.

Bar-Or","Abstract Objective: A few studies report comparable analgesic efficacy between low-dose ketamine and opioids such as morphine or fentanyl; however, limited research has explored the safety and effectiveness of intravenous low-dose ketamine as a primary analgesic in a civilian prehospital setting. The objective of this study is to compare pain control between low-dose ketamine and fentanyl when administered intravenously (IV) for the indication of severe pain. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational review of prehospital adult patients (≥18 years) who presented with severe pain (numeric rating scale, 7–10) and were treated solely with either low-dose ketamine IV or fentanyl IV between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. Propensity matched analysis was performed adjusting for all baseline variables with p ≤ 0.10 and for baseline pain score to match ketamine and fentanyl patients on a one-to-one ratio. The primary outcome was change in pain score from baseline to after treatment and evaluated with a paired t-test. Secondary outcomes were changes in vital signs and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) from baseline to after treatment, as well as incidence of clinically significant adverse events (AEs); AEs were followed from scene arrival through emergency department discharge. Results: Propensity matched analysis produced 79 matched pairs. Ketamine IV patients, receiving a mean (SD) dose of 0.3 (0.1) mg/kg, showed a significantly larger mean decrease in pain after treatment, compared to the fentanyl IV patients (−5.5 (3.1) vs. −2.5 (2.4), p < 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving ketamine IV achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain compared to those receiving fentanyl IV (67% vs. 19%, p < 0.001), marking 52 ketamine IV patients as responders to treatment. Vital signs demonstrated a nonsignificant decrease in blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and GCS. No clinically significant AEs were reported for patients receiving ketamine IV. Conclusion: The significant reduction in pain, significantly high proportion of ketamine responders, and the lack of clinically significant AEs characterizing patients receiving low-dose ketamine IV compared to fentanyl IV, all provide further support for its use as an effective prehospital analgesic.

In search of a European economic imaginary of competition: fifty years of the Commission’s annual reports,Or Brook,"Abstract The term ‘competition’ is a core notion for social and economic thinking and the organisation of markets. Nevertheless, this paper shows that there is no single acceptable economic imaginary ascribed to the notion in Europe. The search for the meaning of competition is an ongoing journey, from the EU’s very inception 60 years ago to the present day, which is inherently tied to the objectives, scope, and boundaries of EU (competition) law and to socio-economic transformations. The paper first reviews the history of the notion in both common-usage language and in legal-economic thinking. It exposes the emergence of three parallel, partly conflicting, imaginaries influencing the notion in EU competition law: Keynesian, ordoliberal, and neoliberal. After demonstrating that no single imaginary was adopted by EU primary, secondary, or soft laws, it applies Critical Discourse Analysis to the Commission’s annual reports on competition (1971–2020) in search for the meaning of competition. The paper reveals that the notion of competition had acquired one meaning in ‘hard’ contexts of the enforcement (scope of the prohibition of competition; exceptions or justifications for allowing otherwise anti-competitive behaviour), and another meaning in ‘softer’ contexts (mandates of the competition rules, and to a lesser extent – selection of enforcement priorities). While the ‘hard’ contexts have experienced a transformation from Keynesian and ordoliberal imaginary of competition to a neoliberal notion; the ‘soft’ contexts still invoke a broader notion reflecting influences from all three theories. Finally, the paper argues that although the lack of a clear definition for competition undoubtedly raises challenges relating to the rule of law, legal certainty, and uniformity, its ambiguity also serves as a powerful tool in safeguarding the durability and legitimacy of competition as an economic imaginary. It allows tailoring the notion of competition to changing legal, economic, and social conditions without a Treaty amendment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c63c5010927f0dd1c8b54d66a071bdca65d81b77,c63c5010927f0dd1c8b54d66a071bdca65d81b77,search european economic imaginary competition fifty year commission ’ annual report,Or Brook,abstract term ‘ competition ’ core notion social economic thinking organisation market nevertheless paper show single acceptable economic imaginary ascribed notion europe search meaning competition ongoing journey eu ’ inception 60 year ago present day inherently tied objective scope boundary eu competition law socio-economic transformation paper first review history notion common-usage language legal-economic thinking expose emergence three parallel partly conflicting imaginary influencing notion eu competition law keynesian ordoliberal neoliberal demonstrating single imaginary adopted eu primary secondary soft law applies critical discourse analysis commission ’ annual report competition 1971–2020 search meaning competition paper reveals notion competition acquired one meaning ‘ hard ’ context enforcement scope prohibition competition exception justification allowing otherwise anti-competitive behaviour another meaning ‘ softer ’ context mandate competition rule lesser extent – selection enforcement priority ‘ hard ’ context experienced transformation keynesian ordoliberal imaginary competition neoliberal notion ‘ soft ’ context still invoke broader notion reflecting influence three theory finally paper argues although lack clear definition competition undoubtedly raise challenge relating rule law legal certainty uniformity ambiguity also serf powerful tool safeguarding durability legitimacy competition economic imaginary allows tailoring notion competition changing legal economic social condition without treaty amendment,search european economic imaginary competition fifty year commission ’ annual report abstract term ‘ competition ’ core notion social economic thinking organisation market nevertheless paper show single acceptable economic imaginary ascribed notion europe search meaning competition ongoing journey eu ’ inception 60 year ago present day inherently tied objective scope boundary eu competition law socio-economic transformation paper first review history notion common-usage language legal-economic thinking expose emergence three parallel partly conflicting imaginary influencing notion eu competition law keynesian ordoliberal neoliberal demonstrating single imaginary adopted eu primary secondary soft law applies critical discourse analysis commission ’ annual report competition 1971–2020 search meaning competition paper reveals notion competition acquired one meaning ‘ hard ’ context enforcement scope prohibition competition exception justification allowing otherwise anti-competitive behaviour another meaning ‘ softer ’ context mandate competition rule lesser extent – selection enforcement priority ‘ hard ’ context experienced transformation keynesian ordoliberal imaginary competition neoliberal notion ‘ soft ’ context still invoke broader notion reflecting influence three theory finally paper argues although lack clear definition competition undoubtedly raise challenge relating rule law legal certainty uniformity ambiguity also serf powerful tool safeguarding durability legitimacy competition economic imaginary allows tailoring notion competition changing legal economic social condition without treaty amendment,8,8_international_law_legal_nsa
A Lifespan Development Theory of Insecure Attachment and Internalizing Symptoms: Integrating Meta-Analytic Evidence via a Testable Evolutionary Mis/Match Hypothesis,"Or Dagan, A. Groh, S. Madigan, K. Bernard","Attachment scholars have long argued that insecure attachment patterns are associated with vulnerability to internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. However, accumulating evidence from the past four decades, summarized in four large meta-analyses evaluating the link between insecure attachment subtypes and internalizing symptoms, provide divergent evidence for this claim. This divergent evidence may be accounted for, at least in part, by the developmental period under examination. Specifically, children with histories of deactivating (i.e., insecure/avoidant) but not hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/resistant) attachment patterns in infancy and early childhood showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In contrast, adolescents and adults with hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/preoccupied) but not deactivating (i.e., insecure/dismissing) attachment classifications showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In this paper, we summarize findings from four large meta-analyses and highlight the divergent meta-analytic findings that emerge across different developmental periods. We first present several potential methodological issues that may have contributed to these divergent findings. Then, we leverage clinical, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives to propose a testable lifespan development theory of attachment and internalizing symptoms that integrates findings across meta-analyses. According to this theory, subtypes of insecure attachment patterns may be differentially linked to internalizing symptoms depending on their mis/match with the developmentally appropriate orientation tendency toward caregivers (in childhood) or away from them (i.e., toward greater independence in post-childhood). Lastly, we offer future research directions to test this theory.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/807748c6eb2d040eafdc93e0d6d69229b614d75e,807748c6eb2d040eafdc93e0d6d69229b614d75e,lifespan development theory insecure attachment internalizing symptom integrating meta-analytic evidence via testable evolutionary mis/match hypothesis,"Or Dagan, A.

The studies captured audio data in various contexts (e.g., in-person daily conversations, phone calls) and used common audio features (e.g., pitch and volume) to ascertain clinically relevant outcomes, including mood and social rhythm. Findings suggest that the utility of audio data in clinical and research contexts remains relatively unexplored and presents some challenges.

"Flight Data Acquisition Platform Development, Integration, and Operation on Small- to Medium-Sized Unmanned Aircraft","Or D. Dantsker, R. Mancuso","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly increasing in popularity for civilian, military, and research applications, and as part of this uptrend, signiﬁcant effort has been undertaken to integrate an increasing amount of sensing into these vehicles. This sensing, or in other words, acquisition of sensor data, is part of the core functionality of UAVs — without the ability to sense, an unmanned aircraft is unable to function. By intelligently integrating sensors into a vehicle and properly interfacing with them, one is able to derive streams of data from these sensors, which allow the aircraft to ﬂy and the desired mission to occur. In just the past several years, along with the uptrend in UAV use, there has been an increase in the research to evaluate and improve aircraft performance and ﬂight characteristics. All of these efforts depend on the ability to acquire and utilize high ﬁdelity data from a large range of sensors and devices. This paper will ﬁrst provide an overview for the development of a data acquisition system. It will then focus on the design aspects involved including system architecture, sensing interfaces, common sensors, and user interface.

Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Precise Fingerprint Recognition,"Md. Harun Or Rashid, Sabiha Rahman, Jebunnesa Satu, A. Tariq","Fingerprint recognition is a technique which is used for identifying people automatically. This technique is one of the most effective and popular biometric techniques. The effectiveness of this technique is depends on the quality of the fingerprint which was given as input. If the quality of fingerprint is noise free then it is possible to detect a reliable set of features otherwise it is not possible. The name of the dataset used in this research is Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset. Original data and altered data from the dataset have been used. There have several algorithms for fingerprint recognition which is offered by the recent advances pattern recognition and machine learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the algorithms for fingerprint recognition. Image processing speed is very high in this algorithm. In this paper, the focus is on recognizing fingerprints with the use of CNN. It have a very high performance and for that reason this algorithm is used for classification and recognition of image. It follows a hierarchical model for build a network just like a funnel and gives a layer that are fully connected. In this network neurons are connected together where the output is processed.

Scaling concurrent queues by using HTM to profit from failed atomic operations,"Or Ostrovsky, Adam Morrison","Queues are fundamental concurrent data structures, but despite years of research, even the state-of-the-art queues scale poorly. This poor scalability occurs because of contended atomic read-modify-write (RMW) operations. This paper makes a first step towards designing a scalable linearizable queue. We leverage hardware transactional memory (HTM) to design TxCAS, a scalable compare-and-set (CAS) primitive---despite HTM being targeted mainly at uncontended scenarios. Leveraging TxCAS's scalability requires a queue design that does not blindly retry failed CASs. We thus apply TxCAS to the baskets queue, which steers enqueuers whose CAS fails into dedicated basket data structures. Coupled with a new, scalable basket algorithm, we obtain SBQ, the scalable baskets queue.

Early versus late arteriovenous malformation responders after stereotactic radiosurgery: an international multicenter study.,"O. Cohen-Inbar, Robert M. Starke, Robert M. Starke, Gabriella M. Paisan, H. Kano, P. Huang, rafael rodriguez-Mercado, L. Almodóvar, I. Grills, D. Mathieu, Danilo Silva, Mahmoud Abbassy, S. Missios, John Y. K. Lee, G. Barnett, D. Kondziolka, L. Lunsford, J. Sheehan","OBJECTIVE The goal of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is complete nidus obliteration, thereby eliminating the risk of future hemorrhage. This outcome can be observed within the first 18 months, although documentation of AVM obliteration can extend to as much as 5 years after SRS is performed. A shorter time to obliteration may impact the frequency and effect of post-SRS complications and latency hemorrhage. The authors' goal in the present study was to determine predictors of early obliteration (18 months or less) following SRS for cerebral AVM. METHODS Eight centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) obtained institutional review board approval to supply de-identified patient data. From a cohort of 2231 patients, a total of 1398 patients had confirmed AVM obliteration. Patients were sorted into early responders (198 patients), defined as those with confirmed nidus obliteration at or prior to 18 months after SRS, and late responders (1200 patients), defined as those with confirmed nidus obliteration more than 18 months after SRS. The median clinical follow-up time was 63.7 months (range 7-324.7 months). RESULTS Outcome parameters including latency interval hemorrhage, mortality, and favorable outcome were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Radiologically demonstrated radiation-induced changes were noted more often in the late responder group (376 patients [31.3%] vs 39 patients [19.7%] for early responders, p = 0.005). Multivariate independent predictors of early obliteration included a margin dose > 24 Gy (p = 0.031), prior surgery (p = 0.002), no prior radiotherapy (p = 0.025), smaller AVM nidus (p = 0.002), deep venous drainage (p = 0.039), and nidus location (p < 0.0001). Basal ganglia, cerebellum, and frontal lobe nidus locations favored early obliteration (p = 0.009). The Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (VRAS) score was significantly different between the 2 responder groups (p = 0.039).

For early obliteration, such prognostic ability was not shown for other SRS- and AVM-related grading systems.

Feasibility and acceptability of electronic EQ-5D-5L for routine measurement of HRQOL in patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems in Hong Kong primary care,"A. P. P. Ng, Kiki S N Liu, W. H. Cheng, C. Wong, John King Yiu Cheng, J. Lam, C. Or, E. Tse, C. Lam","Background Information on HRQOL can enhance patient diagnosis and management but it is rarely available in routine clinical practice. This mixed-method study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the electronic EQ-5D-5L measurement of HRQOL in patients with chronic musculoskeletal problems in primary care. Methods In three primary care clinics, 665 patients with musculoskeletal problems completed the electronic EQ-5D-5L and Visual Analogue Scale (e-EQ-5D-5L/VAS), and a questionnaire on socio-demographics, perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived usefulness (PU) at baseline and two follow-ups. Patient completion and response rates, and time to complete the e-EQ-5D-5L/VAS were measured. During the same consultations, 49 doctors reviewed the e-EQ-5D-5L/VAS reports and completed a clinician questionnaire on PEOU, PU, and time spent to address each report. Individual interviews along with focus group discussions were conducted on patients, doctors, and research assistants for further exploration. Results Mean completion time reduced from baseline to first and second follow-up (120.66, 83.99, and 105.22 s, respectively). Completion and response rates were high at each follow-up visit (> 99.8% and > 91.11%, respectively). Doctors needed less than 2 min to read the report but felt the time required to address the report was a significant barrier. Some patients had difficulties using e-platforms, in understanding or answering questions; but, PEOU improved with time ( p  < 0.001). Most patients found the e-platforms useful (> 85.3%). Clinicians agreed a great majority of the reports were easy to use (76.0–85.1%) and useful (69.2–72.0%), particularly aiding with a holistic view of the patient's musculoskeletal problem.

Potential therapeutic effects of GS-441524 and GC376 in cats with feline infectious peritonitis,"Omid Nekouei, S. St-Hilaire, Pak Chun Hui, K. Chan, I. Chan, Sum Yuet Lorraine Ngan, Y. Chan, Ka Po Chung, S. Hong, Hiu Man Chan, Hoi Lam Iris Or, Fong Yuen Chan, Hei Tung Yim, V. Barrs","PICO question 
In cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), does treatment with the nucleoside analogue GS-441524 or the protease inhibitor GC376, compared to supportive measures alone, lead to longer survival times? 
  
Clinical bottom line 
Category of research question 
Treatment 
The number and type of study designs reviewed 
Five studies, including four uncontrolled interventional studies and one case-series were critically reviewed 
Strength of evidence 
Moderate 
Outcomes reported 
The reviewed studies collectively provide moderate evidence in support of the application of GS-441524 or GC376 to extend the survival time of cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis 
Conclusion 
While these antiviral drugs are considered the most likely options for FIP treatment, more robust evidence should be obtained through well-designed randomised controlled trials to verify the observed positive effects in treating various forms of the disease and the potential long-term side effects. However, the ethical dilemmas of conducting double blinded placebo-controlled trials, which by necessity include untreated cats with an invariably fatal disease are recognised 
  
How to apply this evidence in practice 
The application of evidence into practice should take into account multiple factors, not limited to: individual clinical expertise, patient’s circumstances and owners’ values, country, location or clinic where you work, the individual case in front of you, the availability of therapies and resources.

These tasks require capabilities that generalize to a wide range of small scale UAV research. In particular, we believe that sharing our design and construction approaches can benefit the research community. An important criterion in development of a research model is its ability to support testing and development of new technologies in a time- and cost-effective manner. Our work achieved this and can perform multiple tasks without transitioning or replacing hardware. The platform itself is constructed out of commercial off the shelf components, in order to decrease development time and costs, and is also capable of performing aggressive maneuvering, which is unusual for research UAVs at the 1.8-meter wingspan scale.

"Knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of earthquake preparedness amongst the elderly in risk areas","Tanika Songlar, Nicharuch Panjaphothiwat Pussadee La-or, Chalitar Chomchoe, Siriyaporn Khunthason","
Purpose
Chiang Rai being an earthquake-prone city, it is essential to raise awareness about earthquake safety and readiness, especially amongst the elderly population who spend most of their time at home. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the earthquake preparedness of elders in relation to knowledge, attitude and practice.


Design/methodology/approach
This was an analytic cross-sectional study. Research data were collected from 480 elders of 60 years old and above. The research instruments were questionnaires about knowledge, attitude and self-assessment of practices in earthquake situations. Data were analyzed by number, percentage and a χ2 test.


Findings
Of participants interviewed, 39.4 percent were aged between 60 and 66 years old. Overall, 94.0 percent of them had already experienced an earthquake, with 79.4 percent having experienced it in 2014. Participants had a good level of knowledge and attitude toward earthquake safety. Their practices toward earthquake readiness, however, were insufficient due to the lower practice scores (<12), especially found in the high seismic zone. The score level of knowledge, attitude and self-assessment of practice in earthquake situations showed that there is a difference in statistical significance (p<0.05).


Originality/value
This study focuses attention on the need to increase levels of preparedness. Safety instructions and earthquake drills should be promoted and supported in order to prepare elders for an earthquake in the study area. Research findings identified in this study will help to address the specific needs of the elderly when implementing an earthquake disaster risk reduction plan.

Exploring the effects of health care on mortality across OECD countries,Z. Or,"Two of the most important questions facing health policy makers in OECD countries are:
whether the increasing sums of money devoted to health care are yielding commensurate value in terms of improvements in health status; and

Finding root causes is crucial for learning from disasters; however, there has not been much investigation of the economic damage root causes with regard to the 2011 Chao Phraya river flood disaster. This paper seeks to investigate the root causes of the economic damage by organizing the existing analytical frameworks, tools and approaches to clarify why industrial parks and estates experienced such substantial economic devastation that resonated worldwide. The study’s research design includes a social background survey, in-depth interview surveys and an investigation of the disaster’s root causes. Through the research, inadequate urban and land use planning facilitated by a decentralization policy, foreign companies settlement in the country, which involved urbanization and relocation without proper risk assessment, information, and knowledge, and supplier’s responsibility based on the supply chain’s structure, are detected as root causes for the high economic damage in the industrial complex area. This study also provides key lessons essential to building regional resilience in industrial complex areas: 1) considering the potential risks of regional planning, which include both socio-economic and climate changes; 2) clarifying the roles of companies, regions, and nations in sharing risk information with related stakeholders before, during, and after a disaster; and 3) building horizontal and vertical collaborations among all related stakeholders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61303998e98dc5cc39f2abd7f8cc71a93b6dac66,61303998e98dc5cc39f2abd7f8cc71a93b6dac66,finding devastating economic disaster ’ root cause 2011 flood thailand supply chain make disaster worse,"T.

Propulsion System Instrumentation Development and Integration on Small- and Medium-Sized Electric Unmanned Aircraft,"Or D. Dantsker, R. Mancuso","With the increasing popularity of unmanned aircraft for both research, military, and commercial applications, signiﬁcant effort has been undertaken in order to improve these aircraft’s performance and ﬂight characteristics. Unmanned aircraft research and development is often based on or culminates with ﬂight testing and signiﬁcant effort has been undertaken to integrate an increasing amount of sensing into these vehicles. In the end all ﬂight testing efforts depend on the ability to acquire and utilize high ﬁdelity ﬂight data from a large range of sensors and devices. On electrically-propelled unmanned aircraft, collecting propulsion system data is especially vital in determining aircraft state. Broadly, this includes: rotation rate(s) of propellers, fans, or rotors; voltage, current, and temperature at each system component, and energy state of storage components. To collect these measurements, sensors are placed throughout an aircraft with data being sent to a central avionics system, such as a data acquisition system or autopilot. This paper focuses on the requirements, design, development, and integration to perform in-ﬂight measurements of propulsion system parameters on small-and medium-sized electric unmanned aircraft.

The effects of molding water content and compaction delay, on soaked CBR of both Ashes stabilized expansive soil have also been studied. CBR tests were performed with fly-ash and bagasse ash separately at different percentage variations with the increment of 2.5% by weight in order to find out which one is most suitable for stabilization of subgrade material.

Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error Rate,"D. Aharonov, M. Ben-Or","This paper shows that quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant against errors and inaccuracies when $\eta$, the probability for an error in a qubit or a gate, is smaller than a constant threshold $\eta_c$. This result improves on Shor's result [Proceedings of the 37th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, 1996, pp. 56-65], which shows how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation when the error rate $\eta$ decays polylogarithmically with the size of the computation, an assumption which is physically unreasonable. The cost of making the quantum circuit fault-tolerant in our construction is polylogarithmic in time and space. Our result holds for a very general local noise model, which includes probabilistic errors, decoherence, amplitude damping, depolarization, and systematic inaccuracies in the gates. Moreover, we allow exponentially decaying correlations between the errors both in space and in time. Fault-tolerant computation can be performed with any universal set of gates. The result also holds for quantum particles with $p>2$ states, namely, $p$-qudits, and is also generalized to one-dimensional quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. We estimate the threshold of our construction to be $\eta_c\simeq 10^{-6}$, in the best case. By this we show that local noise is in principle not an obstacle for scalable quantum computation. The main ingredient of our proof is the computation on states encoded by a quantum error correcting code (QECC). To this end we introduce a special class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, called polynomial codes (the quantum analogue of Reed-Solomon codes). Their nice algebraic structure allows all of the encoded gates to be transversal. We also provide another version of the proof which uses more general CSS codes, but its encoded gates are slightly less elegant. To achieve fault tolerance, we encode the quantum circuit by another circuit by using one of these QECCs. This step is repeated polyloglog many times, each step slightly improving the effective error rate, to achieve the desired reliability. The resulting circuit exhibits a hierarchical structure, and for the analysis of its robustness we borrow terminology from Khalfin and Tsirelson [Found. Phys., 22 (1992), pp. 879-948] and Gacs [Advances in Computing Research: A Research Annual: Randomness and Computation, JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, 1989]. The paper is to a large extent self-contained. In particular, we provide simpler proofs for many of the known results we use, such as the fact that it suffices to correct for bit-flips and phase-flips, the correctness of CSS codes, and the fact that two-qubit gates are universal, together with their extensions to higher-dimensional particles. We also provide full proofs of the universality of the sets of gates we use (the proof of universality was missing in Shor's paper). This paper thus provides a self-contained and complete proof of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of local noise.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1c8c72ba400ae96f90fdaa544b78ae26a8866eb,e1c8c72ba400ae96f90fdaa544b78ae26a8866eb,fault-tolerant quantum computation constant error rate,"D.

Deep Class Aware Denoising,"T. Remez, O. Litany, R. Giryes, A. Bronstein","The increasing demand for high image quality in mobile devices brings forth the need for better computational enhancement techniques, and image denoising in particular. At the same time, the images captured by these devices can be categorized into a small set of semantic classes. However simple, this observation has not been exploited in image denoising until now. In this paper, we demonstrate how the reconstruction quality improves when a denoiser is aware of the type of content in the image. To this end, we first propose a new fully convolutional deep neural network architecture which is simple yet powerful as it achieves state-of-the-art performance even without being class-aware. We further show that a significant boost in performance of up to $0.4$ dB PSNR can be achieved by making our network class-aware, namely, by fine-tuning it for images belonging to a specific semantic class.

Flight Testing Automation to Parameterize Unmanned Aircraft Dynamics,"Or D. Dantsker, Simon Yu, Moiz Vahora, M. Caccamo","In recent years, we have seen an uptrend in the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) driven by the desire to apply these aircraft to a variety of civilian, commercial, education, government, and military applications. With the rapid increase in UAV application, signiﬁcant effort has been put forth into research and development, which culminates with ﬂight testing of the vehicle. Flight testing occurs using either a partial-scale or a full-scale prototype and includes a series of maneuvers used to measure and verify the aircraft’s aerodynamics and control behavior. Most often, UAVs are manually piloted through at least the initial ﬂight testing stage where ﬂight qualities are recorded and translated into control tuning. This paper describes a ﬂight testing automation process to streamline the parameterization of an unmanned aircraft’s ﬂight dynamics. The developed ﬂight testing automator commands the aircraft through a predetermined, conditional set of motions and states to induce certain maneuver sets, which allow for dynamics to more easily be parameterized. The desired maneuver sets follow the standards and generally accepted practices for full-scale ﬂight testing. Speciﬁcally, the maneuvers of interest presented in this paper include: idle descent, stall, phugoid, doublets, and singlets, which provide the basis for determining the aircraft aerodynamics, longitudinal stability, and control effectiveness, respectively. The ﬂight testing automator was implemented and demonstrated using software-in-the-loop simulation, including a comparison with manually-piloted ﬂight, followed by ﬂight testing using a ﬁxed-wing trainer-type UAV. Automating the data collection process, as opposed to the previous status quo of manual piloting, would allow for more efﬁcient aircraft parametrization and modelling by minimizing trial-and-error and, more importantly, reducing the ﬂight time required.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e796281c3e9ef52845452108b8b23829d7226fa,2e796281c3e9ef52845452108b8b23829d7226fa,flight testing automation parameterize unmanned aircraft dynamic,"Or D.

Inferring object properties from human interaction and transferring them to new motions,"Qian Zheng, Weikai Wu, Hanting Pan, N. Mitra, D. Cohen-Or, Hui Huang","Humans regularly interact with their surrounding objects. Such interactions often result in strongly correlated motions between humans and the interacting objects. We thus ask: “Is it possible to infer object properties from skeletal motion alone, even without seeing the interacting object itself?” In this paper, we present a fine-grained action recognition method that learns to infer such latent object properties from human interaction motion alone. This inference allows us to disentangle the motion from the object property and transfer object properties to a given motion. We collected a large number of videos and 3D skeletal motions of performing actors using an inertial motion capture device. We analyzed similar actions and learned subtle differences between them to reveal latent properties of the interacting objects. In particular, we learned to identify the interacting object, by estimating its weight, or its spillability. Our results clearly demonstrate that motions and interacting objects are highly correlated and that related object latent properties can be inferred from 3D skeleton sequences alone, leading to new synthesis possibilities for motions involving human interaction.

Stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial hemangiopericytomas: a multicenter study.,"O. Cohen-Inbar, Cheng-chia Lee, S. Mousavi, H. Kano, D. Mathieu, A. Meola, P. Nakaji, N. Honea, Matthew D. Johnson, Mahmoud Abbassy, A. Mohammadi, Danilo Silva, Huai-che Yang, I. Grills, D. Kondziolka, G. Barnett, L. Lunsford, J. Sheehan","OBJECTIVE Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare tumors widely recognized for their aggressive clinical behavior, high recurrence rates, and distant and extracranial metastases even after a gross-total resection. The authors report a large multicenter study, through the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF), reviewing management and outcome following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent or newly discovered HPCs. METHODS Eight centers participating in the IGKRF participated in this study. A total of 90 patients harboring 133 tumors were identified. Patients were included if they had a histologically diagnosed HPC managed with SRS during the period 1988-2014 and had a minimum of 6 months' clinical and radiological follow-up. A de-identified database was created. The patients' median age was 48.5 years (range 13-80 years). Prior treatments included embolization (n = 8), chemotherapy (n = 2), and fractionated radiotherapy (n = 34). The median tumor volume at the time of SRS was 4.9 cm3 (range 0.2-42.4 cm3). WHO Grade II (typical) HPCs formed 78.9% of the cohort (n = 71). The median margin and maximum doses delivered were 15 Gy (range 2.8-24 Gy) and 32 Gy (range 8-51 Gy), respectively. The median clinical and radiographic follow-up periods were 59 months (range 6-190 months) and 59 months (range 6-183 months), respectively. Prognostic variables associated with local tumor control and post-SRS survival were evaluated using Cox univariate and multivariate analysis. Actuarial survival after SRS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Imaging studies performed at last follow-up demonstrated local tumor control in 55% of tumors and 62.2% of patients. New remote intracranial tumors were found in 27.8% of patients, and 24.4% of patients developed extracranial metastases. Adverse radiation effects were noted in 6.7% of patients. During the study period, 32.2% of the patients (n = 29) died. The actuarial overall survival was 91.5%, 82.1%, 73.9%, 56.7%, and 53.7% at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively, after initial SRS. Local progression-free survival (PFS) was 81.7%, 66.3%, 54.5%, 37.2%, and 25.5% at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively, after initial SRS. In our cohort, 32 patients underwent 48 repeat SRS procedures for 76 lesions. Review of these 76 treated tumors showed that 17 presented as an in-field recurrence and 59 were defined as an out-of-field recurrence. Margin dose greater than 16 Gy (p = 0.037) and tumor grade (p = 0.006) were shown to influence PFS. The development of extracranial metastases was shown to influence overall survival (p = 0.029) in terms of PFS; repeat (multiple) SRS showed additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS SRS provides a reasonable rate of local tumor control and a low risk of adverse effects. It also leads to neurological stability or improvement in the majority of patients. Long-term close clinical and imaging follow-up is necessary due to the high probability of local recurrence and distant metastases. Repeat SRS is often effective for treating new or recurrent HPCs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae0bedf59d39171a686bd115ebb070dc5eb00e33,ae0bedf59d39171a686bd115ebb070dc5eb00e33,stereotactic radiosurgery intracranial hemangiopericytomas multicenter study,"O.

Paying for hospital care: the experience with implementing activity-based funding in five European countries,"J. O’Reilly, R. Busse, U. Häkkinen, Z. Or, A. Street, M. Wiley","Abstract Following the US experience, activity-based funding has become the most common mechanism for reimbursing hospitals in Europe. Focusing on five European countries (England, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland), this paper reviews the motivation for introducing activity-based funding, together with the empirical evidence available to assess the impact of implementation. Despite differences in the prevailing approaches to reimbursement, the five countries shared several common objectives, albeit with different emphasis, in moving to activity-based funding during the 1990s and 2000s. These include increasing efficiency, improving quality of care and enhancing transparency. There is substantial cross-country variation in how activity-based funding has been implemented and developed. In Finland and Ireland, for instance, activity-based funding is principally used to determine hospital budgets, whereas the models adopted in the other three countries are more similar to the US approach. Assessing the impact of activity-based funding is complicated by a shortage of rigorous empirical evaluations. What evidence is currently available, though, suggests that the introduction of activity-based funding has been associated with an increase in activity, a decline in length of stay and/or a reduction in the rate of growth in hospital expenditure in most of the countries under consideration.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/553f806d0cacb186c5e2781bac2185d2b23a5ec9,553f806d0cacb186c5e2781bac2185d2b23a5ec9,paying hospital care experience implementing activity-based funding five european country,"J.

Design Methodology for a Dynamically-Scaled General Aviation Aircraft,"G. Ananda, Moiz Vahora, Or D. Dantsker, M. Selig","This paper discusses the motivation, requirements, and approach of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) General Aviation Upset and Stall Testing Aircraft Research (GA-USTAR) project. The goal of the GA-USTAR project is to build and flight test a dynamically-scaled, Reynold number corrected model of a General Aviation (GA) type aircraft intended for upset and stall flight modeling. The project is separated into three phases. In Phase 1, to simplify the construction, a scaled commercial-of-the-shelf radio control (R/C) model of a GA aircraft is used as a starting point. From a list of available GA aircraft R/C models, a 1/5scale Cessna 182 was selected. The methodology behind the choice of the Cessna 182 as the GA-USTAR Phase 1 (baseline) model is detailed. The method of accurately determining the mass distribution and inertias is described in detail. In Phase 2, the approach taken to appropriately dynamically scale the Phase 1 Cessna 182 model is discussed. The desired geometric, kinematic, and mass parameters for a dynamically-scaled Cessna 182 is discussed. Finally, to ensure that stall is closely matched, new airfoils will be designed and tested in the UIUC subsonic wind tunnel and then used on the GA-USTAR Phase 3 flight platform. New airfoils are required to correct for the Reynolds number effects inherent in scaled models. Flight testing and data acquisition will be performed for all three phases of the GA-USTAR project. Details regarding flight data instrumentation and flight test planning are also described in this paper.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc3c5b0bd3ce81e1206f162aaa18579cd647f247,cc3c5b0bd3ce81e1206f162aaa18579cd647f247,design methodology dynamically-scaled general aviation aircraft,"G.

Energy Efficient Fitness Based Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Network,"M. Ashrafuddin, Md. Manowarul Islam, Md. Mamun-Or-Rashid","Underwater sensor network is one of the potential research arenas that opens the window of pleasing a lot of researcher in studying the field. Network layer of the underwater sensor networks must be one of the most attractive fields to build up anew protocol. In this paper, we proposed a underwater sensor network routing protocol named Energy Efficient Fitness based routing protocol for under water sensor networks (EEF) that promises the best use of total energy consumptions. The proposed routing protocol takes into account residual energy, depth and distance from the forwarding node to the sink node to guide a packet from source to the destination node. The prominent advantages of the proposed protocol are to confirm higher network life time and less end to end delay. The proposed protocol does not use control packet that causes much energy consumption and end to end delay. Simulation has been performed to certify the better result of the proposed routing protocol.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/92b22ad852bb2baef1dc90c2fe3813a14ca71049,92b22ad852bb2baef1dc90c2fe3813a14ca71049,energy efficient fitness based routing protocol underwater sensor network,"M.

Quantum Technology for Economists,"Isaiah Hull, Or Sattath, E. Diamanti, G. Wendin","Research on quantum technology spans multiple disciplines: physics, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The objective of this manuscript is to provide an accessible introduction to this emerging field for economists that is centered around quantum computing and quantum money. We proceed in three steps. First, we discuss basic concepts in quantum computing and quantum communication, assuming knowledge of linear algebra and statistics, but not of computer science or physics. This covers fundamental topics, such as qubits, superposition, entanglement, quantum circuits, oracles, and the no-cloning theorem. Second, we provide an overview of quantum money, an early invention of the quantum communication literature that has recently been partially implemented in an experimental setting. One form of quantum money offers the privacy and anonymity of physical cash, the option to transact without the involvement of a third party, and the efficiency and convenience of a debit card payment. Such features cannot be achieved in combination with any other form of money. Finally, we review all existing quantum speedups that have been identified for algorithms used to solve and estimate economic models. This includes function approximation, linear systems analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, matrix inversion, principal component analysis, linear regression, interpolation, numerical differentiation, and true random number generation. We also discuss the difficulty of achieving quantum speedups and comment on common misconceptions about what is achievable with quantum computing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82439c246b1305d2b055e0d57dcaf1886e5cf709,82439c246b1305d2b055e0d57dcaf1886e5cf709,quantum technology economist,"Isaiah Hull, Or Sattath, E.

Grounding Probability in Narrow Waterways,"Ş. Özlem, Y. C. Altan, E. Otay, I. Or","The Strait of Istanbul is one of the world's busiest, narrowest and most winding waterways. As such, there is a high grounding probability for vessels. Although a number of grounding probability models exist, they have been deemed unsuitable by local maritime experts, due to their insufficient stopping distance criteria for narrow waterways. Thus, there is a need for a new model. This paper proposes a two-component grounding probability model that multiplies the geometric grounding probability (calculated with a kinematic-based model) with the causation probability (calculated with a specially designed Bayesian network). The geometric probability model is improved in terms of stopping distance parameters and the Bayesian network is crafted for narrow waterways. The model is then deployed with pre-determined parameters within the Strait of Istanbul to run risk analysis scenarios. The results, validated with actual grounding records, show that the causation probability is the key component for quantifying the probability of grounding in narrow waterways. If navigated without frequent evasive manoeuvres, grounding would be almost inevitable. Although this study focuses on the Strait of Istanbul, the proposed approach can be applied to research into grounding probability of vessels navigating through other waterways.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/caf92b9749294cd7fe30d421d6e0de7fdfd742e0,caf92b9749294cd7fe30d421d6e0de7fdfd742e0,grounding probability narrow waterway,"Ş.

MoCo‐Flow: Neural Motion Consensus Flow for Dynamic Humans in Stationary Monocular Cameras,"Xuelin Chen, Weiyu Li, D. Cohen-Or, N. Mitra, Baoquan Chen","Synthesizing novel views of dynamic humans from stationary monocular cameras is a specialized but desirable setup. This is particularly attractive as it does not require static scenes, controlled environments, or specialized capture hardware. In contrast to techniques that exploit multi‐view observations, the problem of modeling a dynamic scene from a single view is significantly more under‐constrained and ill‐posed. In this paper, we introduce Neural Motion Consensus Flow (MoCo‐Flow), a representation that models dynamic humans in stationary monocular cameras using a 4D continuous time‐variant function. We learn the proposed representation by optimizing for a dynamic scene that minimizes the total rendering error, over all the observed images. At the heart of our work lies a carefully designed optimization scheme, which includes a dedicated initialization step and is constrained by a motion consensus regularization on the estimated motion flow. We extensively evaluate MoCo‐Flow on several datasets that contain human motions of varying complexity, and compare, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to several baselines and ablated variations of our methods, showing the efficacy and merits of the proposed approach.

Liščák, O. Cohen-Inbar, J. Sheehan, John Y. K. Lee, Mahmoud Abbassy, G. Barnett, D. Mathieu, D. Kondziolka, L. Lunsford","OBJECTIVE
For some jugular foramen schwannomas (JFSs), complete resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for JFSs. The authors reviewed clinical and imaging outcomes of SRS for patients with these tumors.


METHODS
Nine participating centers of the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation identified 92 patients who underwent SRS between 1990 and 2013. Forty-one patients had prior subtotal microsurgical resection. The median interval between previous surgery and SRS was 15 months (range 0.5-144 months). Eighty-four patients had preexisting cranial nerve (CN) symptoms and signs. The median tumor volume was 4.1 cm3 (range 0.8-22.6 cm3), and the median margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-18 Gy). Patients with neurofibromatosis were excluded from this study.


RESULTS
The median follow-up was 51 months (range 6-266 months). Tumors regressed in 47 patients, remained stable in 33, and progressed in 12. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 93% at 3 years, 87% at 5 years, and 82% at 10 years. In the entire series, only a dumbbell shape (extension extracranially via the jugular foramen) was significantly associated with worse PFS. In the group of patients without prior microsurgery (n = 51), factors associated with better PFS included tumor volume < 6 cm3 (p = 0.037) and non-dumbbell-shaped tumors (p = 0.015). Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 27 patients, remained stable in 51, and worsened in 14. The CN function improved after SRS in 12% of patients at 1 year, 24% at 2 years, 27% at 3 years, and 32% at 5 years. Symptomatic adverse radiation effects occurred in 7 patients at a median of 7 months after SRS (range 5-38 months). Six patients underwent repeat SRS at a median of 64 months (range 44-134 months). Four patients underwent resection at a median of 14 months after SRS (range 8-30 months).


CONCLUSIONS
Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be a safe and effective primary or adjuvant management approach for JFSs. Long-term tumor control rates and stability or improvement in CN function were confirmed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20fd3b52656960f6b01d460fa7adb5a83d786826,20fd3b52656960f6b01d460fa7adb5a83d786826,stereotactic radiosurgery jugular foramen schwannomas international multicenter study,"H.

Examining Co-activation Through Cross-Linguistic Influence among Bilinguals in Spoken Language Processing: Evidence from Eye Movements,"Or-Kan Soh, H. Azman, S. Ho","The aim of this paper is to examine the cross-linguistic influences of both early and late bilinguals in spoken language processing and the differences between them. There were four undergraduates, comprising of two early and two late bilinguals, participated voluntarily in this research. The Tobii X 300 was used as the equipment to be applied when measuring and recording the eye-movements of students. Four conditions, namely between competition, within competition, simultaneous competition, and no competition, were designed as the stimuli. Findings were coded as containing zero or greater-than-zero fixations of each condition (if it was present) along with their respective filler (control). The presence of competition can be measured by employing time course sensitive response measures which is the time to first fixation. The results of this study have illustrated through the presence of cross-linguistic influence in bilinguals that the two languages in the bilinguals mind exist in a state of co-activation regardless of their age of acquisition, consistent with previous studies conducted. However, the age of acquisition of a bilingual’s second language differentiates the type of cross-linguistic influence that a bilingual is likely to face when processing their second language.

A Silent Microwave Drill for Deep Holes in Concrete,"E. Jerby, Yuri Nerovny, Y. Meir, Or Korin, R. Peleg, Y. Shamir","This paper presents a mechanically assisted microwave drill (MWD) capable of drilling 26-cm-deep 12-mm-diameter holes in concrete. This record significantly extends the inherent  $\lambda $ /4-depth capability (~1.5 cm at 2.45 GHz) of the basic MWD scheme. Compared with conventional mechanical drills, this MWD is characterized by a relatively silent and vibration-free operation, but its drilling speed is yet slower than 1 cm/min. This paper reviews the fundamental MWD mechanism (utilizing localized microwave heating and thermal-runaway instability), and extends it for deeper holes by also using the coaxial applicator as a slowly rotating hollow reamer to remove the debris. The MWD prototype is introduced, including its adaptive impedance matching and remote-operation features, and its experimental results are presented. Theoretical and practical MWD aspects are discussed, and potential developments are indicated (e.g., for faster drilling and iron-rebar cutting).

Into the soil labyrinth: soil physical structure as a driver of trophic interactions and soil biodiversity,"A. Erktan, D. Or, S. Scheu","
 <p>The high diversity of densely packed organisms occurring in small volumes of soils has long been intriguing and we still poorly understand what drives such diversity. Exploring the role of small scale physical structure of the soil, constituting the habitat of these organisms offers unprecedented clues for explaining how organisms interact, notably through trophic interactions and how, in turn, these interactions drive this extraordinary diversity. We review here how restrictions on soil organisms&#8217; ability to sense (e.g. volatiles) and access food resources/prey imposed by the soil physical structure and aqueous habitats within are important drivers for trophic interactions, and consequently, of soil biodiversity. Examples from micro- to macrofauna are presented, focusing on organisms unable to create their own pore space, such as bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes and microarthropods. Finally, we discuss interdisciplinary challenges to develop research merging soil physics and soil food web ecology.</p>

The Effects of Co-Viewers on the Viewing Experience,Nurit Tal-Or,"
 Although media consumption often occurs with others, relatively few studies have documented the effect of co-viewing on the viewing experience. Moreover, theories of media effects generally focus on the individual and do not pay attention to group processes. Thus, previous co-viewing research has used various theories related to different aspects specific to each study, making it difficult to comprehend the connections between the studies. The aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive model of the effects of co-viewing on the experience of watching a narrative text. Based on existing psychological theories that are applied to co-viewing contexts, the model includes the various processes underlying the effects of co-viewing, along with suggested moderators of these processes. While there is empirical evidence supporting some of the effects the model suggests, others have not yet been investigated. Thus, the model presents new directions for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d06c8f45045fe2571b4c27fa9c65ddcbc3825e0d,d06c8f45045fe2571b4c27fa9c65ddcbc3825e0d,effect co-viewers viewing experience,Nurit Tal,although medium consumption often occurs others relatively study documented effect co-viewing viewing experience moreover theory medium effect generally focus individual pay attention group process thus previous co-viewing research used various theory related different aspect specific study making difficult comprehend connection study aim paper propose comprehensive model effect co-viewing experience watching narrative text based existing psychological theory applied co-viewing context model includes various process underlying effect co-viewing along suggested moderator process empirical evidence supporting effect model suggests others yet investigated thus model present new direction future research,effect co-viewers viewing experience although medium consumption often occurs others relatively study documented effect co-viewing viewing experience moreover theory medium effect generally focus individual pay attention group process thus previous co-viewing research used various theory related different aspect specific study making difficult comprehend connection study aim paper propose comprehensive model effect co-viewing experience watching narrative text based existing psychological theory applied co-viewing context model includes various process underlying effect co-viewing along suggested moderator process empirical evidence supporting effect model suggests others yet investigated thus model present new direction future research,4,4_student_learning_language_course
An Evidence-Based Personal Finance Education Curriculum for Physicians and Medical Students,"J. Igu, S. Zakaria, Yuval D Bar-Or","
 BackgroundMany physicians complete medical school and graduate medical education (GME) burdened by high debt and financial illiteracy. This places them at higher risk for ill-informed financial decisions, which can result in increased stress and anxiety and a lower quality of life. In response, medical wellness programs have increasingly sought to offer personal finance education, but there is little guidance on optimal curricula. Our objective is to systematically review the existing literature examining physician financial literacy curricula and to recommend a standardized curriculum.MethodsThis review utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 checklist to conduct literature searches in PubMed, ERIC, MedEdPortal, EBSCO, JSTOR, and Google Scholar. Three researchers used predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select articles, including a focus on financial concepts applicable in the United States. Articles were assessed using modified Côté-Turgeon and Kirkpatrick qualitative analyses tools. Results38 articles met all inclusion criteria. Six specifically described personal finance literacy curricula for medical students or GME trainees, with varied criteria for selecting instructors, topics, and outcomes. All studies reported that audiences were ill-prepared for making financial decisions but strongly desired financial literacy education. Qualitative analysis revealed Strength of Findings summary scores ranging from 2-4, while applicable Kirkpatrick Model scores were all 3 or greater.ConclusionsAlthough medical students and GME trainees value financial literacy, few publications report the impact of actual curricula. These efforts vary in depth, breadth, and measured impact.

uavAP: A Modular Autopilot Framework for UAVs,"Mirco Theile, Or D. Dantsker, R. Nai, M. Caccamo, Simon Yu","Being applied to many ﬁelds of research and industry, UAVs require reliable but modular autopilot software. An autopilot task can range from simple waypoint following to complex maneuvering or adaptive mission tracking. The developed and presented autopilot, uavAP, aims to be fully modular in a decentralized manner, embracing an object-oriented design in C++. It implements a typical control stack comprising of a mission planner, global planner, local planner, and controller. To facilitate its modularity, uavAP makes use of its core, cpsCore, for module management as well as core utilities. cpsCore administers the conﬁguration, aggregation, and synchronization of all the modules in uavAP. With the emulation environment uavEE, uavAP forms an ecosystem for rapid prototyping and testing of modules for various research directions, ranging from scheduling and memory management, through planning and control system design, to ﬂight proﬁle and conﬁguration optimization. The uavAP-uavEE ecosystem has facilitated the design of an accurate UAV power model based on the aircraft’s physical model, ﬂight maneuver automation for aircraft system identiﬁcation and dynamics parametrization, and an algorithm for geo-fencing of ﬁxed-wing UAVs. This paper describes the control stack of uavAP, its core, cpsCore, as well as application examples highlighting the framework’s modularity and ﬂexibility.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6849f6f67a11f1f7dcf29835f1839806db08c56f,6849f6f67a11f1f7dcf29835f1839806db08c56f,uavap modular autopilot framework uavs,"Mirco Theile, Or D.

Unraveling B lymphocytes in CNS inflammatory diseases,"Bruna Klein da Costa, Renata Brant de Souza Melo, G. Passos, Douglas Gomes Meneses Sevilha Castro, J. Becker, A. Bar-Or, D. Sato","Specific therapies targeting B lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated reductions in disease activity and disability progression. Several observational studies have also shown the effects of targeting B lymphocytes in other rare CNS inflammatory diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and autoimmune encephalitis (AE). However, some drugs targeting cytokine receptors involved in B-lymphocyte maturation and proliferation resulted in negative outcomes in MS. These apparently conflicting findings have stimulated research on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of B lymphocytes in CNS inflammatory diseases. It has been demonstrated that B lymphocytes participate in the pathogenesis of these conditions as antigen-presenting cells, producing proinflammatory cytokines that induce Th1 and Th17 responses and producing antibodies. However, they are also able to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, functioning as regulators of autoimmunity. Understanding these diverse effects is essential for the development of focused treatments. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms that underlie B-lymphocyte involvement in MS, NMOSD, and AE and the outcomes obtained by treatments targeting B lymphocytes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d39cf4adce914326a02d599e1731e2b7a8ab1a1,6d39cf4adce914326a02d599e1731e2b7a8ab1a1,unraveling b lymphocyte cns inflammatory disease,"Bruna Klein da Costa, Renata Brant de Souza Melo, G.

Migration and sustainable development in Thailand,Ruttiya Bhula-or,"
Purpose
Previous studies have focused on migration and development from an economic perspective. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate sustainable migration and development in an integrative manner, including economic, social and environmental perspectives linking theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence in Thailand.


Design/methodology/approach
A framework of migration and sustainable development was developed in a structured and integrative manner, and the shift in migration and development patterns in Thailand was examined from an empirical and theoretical standpoint.


Findings
Migration contributes to Thailand’s economy in many ways. Migrant workers help to grow the economy, especially in labor-intensive sectors. This helps reduced income inequalities at the household level through remittances. Climate change will enhance migration, especially from neighboring countries and within Thailand itself, thus helping to reduce poverty and income inequality. Possible economic gains from migration, as well as circulating workers and international retirement migrants are highlighted.


Research limitations/implications
Only studies published in English or Thai were included, which may have resulted in the omission of some research. A need for rethinking policy design and implementation as a source of sustainable development is required.


Originality/value
Despite the recent influences of political and environmental changes, there has previously been no analysis of migration and sustainable development in Thailand in a structured and integrative manner as in this study. The impact of migration on the diffusion of new technology and brain drain issues was also addressed.

High-speed AFM for 1x node metrology and inspection: Does it damage the features?,"H. Sadeghian, T. C. van den Dool, Y. Uziel, Ron Bar Or","This paper aims at unraveling the mystery of damage in high speed AFMs for 1X node and below. With the device dimensions moving towards the 1X node and below, the semiconductor industry is rapidly approaching the point where existing metrology, inspection and review tools face huge challenges in terms of resolution, the ability to resolve 3D, and throughput. In this paper, we critically asses the important issue of damage in high speed AFM for metrology and inspection of semiconductor wafers. The issues of damage in four major scanning modes (contact mode, tapping mode, non-contact mode, and peak force tapping mode) are described to show which modes are suitable for which applications and which conditions are damaging. The effects of all important scanning parameters on resulting damage are taken into account for materials such as silicon, photoresists and low K materials. Finally, we recommend appropriate scanning parameters and conditions for several use cases (FinFET, patterned photoresist, HAR structures) that avoid exceeding a critical contact stress such that sample damage is minimized. In conclusion, we show using our theoretical analysis that selecting parameters that exceed the target contact stress, indeed leads to significant damage. This method provides AFM users for metrology with a better understanding of contact stresses and enables selection of AFM cantilevers and experimental parameters that prevent sample damage.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/682bd3e7ab616acb740a6b9c6972122499626aea,682bd3e7ab616acb740a6b9c6972122499626aea,high-speed afm 1x node metrology inspection damage feature,"H.

Optimal Consumer Efforts and Operational Costs Based Analysis for a Smart Grid,"H. Howlader, M. E. Lotfy, Ryuto Shigenobu, Hidehito Matayoshi, T. Senjyu","Abstract This paper deals with the comparison approach of operational cost and consumer efforts for the smart grid system. There are two objectives considered for the smart power system i.e. the minimization of the operational cost and consumer efforts of demand responses. Normally, consumers do not want to make much effort for reducing or increasing their loads that is why, this research is done for reducing consumer effort, beside reducing the fuel cost of thermal generations. Consumer efforts have been considered through the real-time pricing of electricity. Mainly a multi-objective algorithm such as Non-Dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) has been utilized to determine the optimum Pareto solution. Also, optimal values of NSGA-II has been compared with Epsilon Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (ε-MOGA). There are three different scenarios reflected in this paper such as case 1, case 2, and case 3 for understanding the importance of consumer efforts. The case 1 considers the minimum operational cost and maximum customer efforts. The case 2 considers the moderate operational cost and moderate customer efforts and the case 3 considers the maximum operational cost and minimum customer efforts.

Laplacian Framework for Interactive Mesh Editing,"Y. Lipman, O. Sorkine-Hornung, Marc Alexa, D. Cohen-Or, David Levin, C. Rössl, Hans-Peter Seidel","Recent works in geometric modeling show the advantage of local differential coordinates in various surface processing applications. In this paper we review recent methods that advocate surface representation via differential coordinates as a basis to interactive mesh editing. One of the main challenges in editing a mesh is to retain the visual appearance of the surface after applying various modifications. The differential coordinates capture the local geometric details and therefore are a natural surface representation for editing applications. The coordinates are obtained by applying a linear operator to the mesh geometry. Given suitable deformation constraints, the mesh geometry is reconstructed from the differential representation by solving a sparse linear system. The differential coordinates are not rotation-invariant and thus their rotation must be explicitly handled in order to retain the correct orientation of the surface details. We review two methods for computing the local rotations: the first estimates them heuristically using a deformation which only preserves the underlying smooth surface, and the second estimates the rotations implicitly through a variational representation of the problem. We show that the linear reconstruction system can be solved fast enough to guarantee interactive response time thanks to a precomputed factorization of the coefficient matrix. We demonstrate that this approach enables to edit complex meshes while retaining the shape of the details in their natural orientation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80a8fdfae74fcc5f82643ab7e4f150a89265f73b,80a8fdfae74fcc5f82643ab7e4f150a89265f73b,laplacian framework interactive mesh editing,"Y.

Community policing in Israel: Resistance and change,"D. Weisburd, Or Shalev, M. Amir","The Israeli National Police began to implement community policing on a large scale in January of 1995. In this paper we describe the main findings of a three year national evaluation of community policing in Israel that was initiated by the Chief Scientist’s office of the Israeli police in the Fall of 1996. When community policing was envisioned and planned in Israel it was seen as part of a total reformation of the Israeli police in structure, philosophy and action. Our research suggests that this broad idea of community policing was not implemented in Israel, and indeed the program of community policing was found to lose ground during the course of our study. While community policing did have specific impacts on the Israeli police, it did not fundamentally change the perspectives and activities of street level police officers. We explain the difficulties encountered in the implementation of community policing in reference to three factors: the speed of implementation of the program; the resistance of traditional military style organizational culture within the Israeli police to the demands of community policing models; and a lack of organizational commitment to community policing. In our conclusions we argue that these barriers to successful community policing are not unique to the Israel case, and are indeed likely to be encountered in the development of community policing in many other countries.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/674c134d0789f2caeeb4518fe9617ff40349c986,674c134d0789f2caeeb4518fe9617ff40349c986,community policing israel resistance change,"D.

A Hybrid CPG–ZMP Controller for the Real-Time Balance of a Simulated Flexible Spine Humanoid Robot,Jimmy Or,"Although a few researchers have started to realize the importance of a flexible spine in generating more natural-looking behaviors for humanoid robots, there has been no work on trying to make a full-body humanoid robot (that has a flexible spine) to maintain balance. The main reason for this is that it is very costly and difficult to develop and control this kind of robot. This paper serves two purposes. First, it proposes the use of a realistic 3-D robot simulator as a platform for costly flexible spine humanoid robotics research. Second, it presents a hybrid CPG-ZMP controller for the simulated robot. The biologically inspired CPG component of our controller allows the mechanical spine and feet to exhibit rhythmic motions using only two control parameters. Through monitoring the measured ZMP location, the engineering component modulates the neural activity of the CPG to allow the robot to maintain balance while it is standing and exhibiting motions on the sagittal and frontal planes in real time. The final postures of the simulated humanoid emerge automatically in real time through dynamic interactions between the neural networks, the robot itself, and its environment. Since experimental results have also demonstrated that our system is robust against disturbances from external pushing forces, our controller has the potential to be applicable to the next generation of humanoid robots.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57e5b109aa65556310d7b14b0425906a505b2e00,57e5b109aa65556310d7b14b0425906a505b2e00,hybrid cpg–zmp controller real-time balance simulated flexible spine humanoid robot,Jimmy Or,although researcher started realize importance flexible spine generating natural-looking behavior humanoid robot work trying make full-body humanoid robot flexible spine maintain balance main reason costly difficult develop control kind robot paper serf two purpose first proposes use realistic 3-d robot simulator platform costly flexible spine humanoid robotics research second present hybrid cpg-zmp controller simulated robot biologically inspired cpg component controller allows mechanical spine foot exhibit rhythmic motion using two control parameter monitoring measured zmp location engineering component modulates neural activity cpg allow robot maintain balance standing exhibiting motion sagittal frontal plane real time final posture simulated humanoid emerge automatically real time dynamic interaction neural network robot environment since experimental result also demonstrated system robust disturbance external pushing force controller potential applicable next generation humanoid robot,hybrid cpg–zmp controller real-time balance simulated flexible spine humanoid robot although researcher started realize importance flexible spine generating natural-looking behavior humanoid robot work trying make full-body humanoid robot flexible spine maintain balance main reason costly difficult develop control kind robot paper serf two purpose first proposes use realistic 3-d robot simulator platform costly flexible spine humanoid robotics research second present hybrid cpg-zmp controller simulated robot biologically inspired cpg component controller allows mechanical spine foot exhibit rhythmic motion using two control parameter monitoring measured zmp location engineering component modulates neural activity cpg allow robot maintain balance standing exhibiting motion sagittal frontal plane real time final posture simulated humanoid emerge automatically real time dynamic interaction neural network robot environment since experimental result also demonstrated system robust disturbance external pushing force controller potential applicable next generation humanoid robot,-1,-1_research_study_paper_analysis
A study on fingertip designs and their influences on performing stable prehension for robot hands,"Keung Or, Shu Morikuni, Shun Ogasa, S. Funabashi, A. Schmitz, S. Sugano","This research aims to clarify and analyze potential factors in fingertip designs and conditions which may affect prehension performances in addition to the control strategy. In this paper, four factors of fingertip designs and conditions are considered: hardness, thickness of the skin, shape and the surface friction condition of the fingertip. Six fingertips were made in order to compare these factors and their influences on grasp stability under different conditions (high and low workload). An evaluation experiment was conducted in order to investigate how the proposed properties affect the grasping performance under different workloads. Results show an unexpected effectiveness of the soft skin grasping performance compared to less deformable materials, even with reduced friction; also the orientation of the fingertips significantly affects the grasping performance in the case of anthropomorphic fingertips. These results can be useful for designing a new robot hand and a control strategy, which can potentially lead to a better stability and efficient performance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cb4266a5287c6a003fc2816038c24c4f3a9762e,5cb4266a5287c6a003fc2816038c24c4f3a9762e,study fingertip design influence performing stable prehension robot hand,"Keung Or, Shu Morikuni, Shun Ogasa, S.

Adjuvanted influenza vaccines,"Orli Even‐Or, S. Samira, R. Ellis, E. Kedar, Y.

Immunization with available vaccines provides incomplete protection against illness caused by influenza virus, especially in high-risk groups such as the elderly and young children. Thus, more efficacious vaccines are needed for the entire population, and all the more so for high-risk groups. One way to improve immune responses and protection is to formulate the vaccine with antigen carriers and/or adjuvants, which can play an important role in improving immune responses and delivery to antigen-presenting cells, especially for a vaccine like influenza that is based on protein antigens usually administered without a carrier or adjuvant.

SDAC-UAS: A sensor data acquisition unmanned aerial system for flight state monitoring and aerodynamic data collection,"Or D. Dantsker, Andrew V. Louis, R. Mancuso, M. Caccamo, M. Selig","This paper presents a sensor data acquisition unmanned aerial system (SDAC-UAS) for flight state monitoring and aerodynamic data collection research on small to mid-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The SDAC-UASwas developed to provide the ground-based human (safety) pilot an easily discernible display of sensor and state data for aircraft monitoring along with providing the ability to remotely start and stop on-board logging. The system is composed of three elements: an unmanned aerial vehicle, the sensor data acquisition system (SDAC), and ground interface. The SDAC is a low power and low weight unit that is fitted onto the UAV and acts as the sensor data distribution hub—the SDAC combines at 100 Hz a large variety of sensor streams into a unified high-fidelity state data stream that is simultaneously: recorded for post-flight analysis, transmitted to the ground to provide telemetry, and forwarded to a separate processing unit, such as an autopilot. Commands are given to the SDAC either locally using a simple interface or remotely using the down-link transceiver connected to the ground interface. The ground interface is a portable computer setup that runs a custom graphical user interface (GUI), which displays the sensor and state data and is used to transmit commands to the SDAC. The entire SDAC-UAS is completely fabricated from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which reduced cost and implementation time; and it is designed such that it can be used with almost any small to mid-sized UAVs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2882ebaf5fbc05065ad5b131ee76682ee94d60a,c2882ebaf5fbc05065ad5b131ee76682ee94d60a,sdac-uas sensor data acquisition unmanned aerial system flight state monitoring aerodynamic data collection,"Or D.

Are health problems systemic? Politics of access and choice under Beveridge and Bismarck systems,"Z. Or, C. Cases, Melanie Lisac, Karsten Vrangbaek, U. Winblad, G. Bevan","Abstract Industrialised countries face similar challenges for improving the performance of their health system. Nevertheless, the nature and intensity of the reforms required are largely determined by each country’s basic social security model. Most reforms in Beveridge-type systems have sought to increase choice and reduce waiting times while those in major Bismarck-type systems have focused on cost control by constraining the choice of providers. This paper looks at the main differences in performance of five countries and reviews their recent reform experience, focusing on three questions: Are there systematic differences in performance of Beveridge and Bismarck-type systems? What are the key parameters of healthcare system, which underlie these differences? Have recent reforms been effective? Our results do not suggest that one system-type performs consistently better than the other. In part, this may be explained by the heterogeneity in organisational design and governance both within and across these systems. Insufficient attention to those structural differences may explain the limited success of a number of recent reforms. Thus, while countries may share similar problems in terms of improving healthcare performance, adopting a ‘copy-and-paste’ approach to healthcare reform is likely to be ineffective.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ad0d527d47ce488ce99a38e66fd7b1a9f727515,1ad0d527d47ce488ce99a38e66fd7b1a9f727515,health problem systemic politics access choice beveridge bismarck system,"Z.

Comparison Approach for Reducing “Demand Response of Consumers” and “Cost of Utility Companies”,"Harun Or Rashid Howlader, Ahmed Yousuf Saber, T. Senjyu","This paper deals with the comparison approach of operational cost and demand response effort of consumers in a smart grid system. There are two objectives considered for this proposed research i.e. the minimization of the operational cost and labor of consumers for demand responses. Normally, consumers do not want to make much labor (or demand response effort) for reducing or increasing their loads that is why this research is done for reducing consumers toil as well as reducing the cost of generations. Labor of consumers has been considered through the real-time pricing of electricity.

Carbon nanotube not only has good biocompatibility but also hold optical adsorption in NIR. In biomimetic and biomedical fields, nanorobots or nanocarriers with external stimuli response for removal the organic pollutants and toxins or drugs in the living body are attractive for research and applications. In this paper, the self-assembly with CNTs containing –COOH and dendrimers having –NH2 groups was carried out. A series of characterizations were performed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra. The adsorption properties and releasing characteristics of CNTs modified with dendrimers were performed with simulating drugs. Some meaningful results were obtained. The photoconductivity response to visible light and 808 nm laser with low-power were studied based on interdigital electrodes of Au on flexible PET(polyethylene terephthalate) film substrate. The results indicated that CNTs modified with dendrimers showed good photo-response to visible light and 808 nm laser.

Data Exchange across Museum Platforms in Thailand,"L. Kovavisaruch, T. Sanpechuda, Krisada Chinda, S. Wisadsud, T. Wongsatho, Anuwat Chiwongyen","The concept of aggregating museum data to be shared amongst organizations and museum visitors is not novel one; however, it has historically been difficult to sell. Within the United States, the development of a shared network amongst nine art museums took 40 years to complete. As most museums in Thailand still operate on a paper-based catalog, we are a long way from even transitioning Thai museum catalogs into the digital era. However, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) has initiated two platforms to begin progress towards modernizing our museum experience; e-Museum, a collection management system, and Museum Pool, a content management tool. With funding from Thailand Research Funding, we were able to implement these two platforms on six museums in Northern Thailand. To increase the success rate of this project, a standard communication protocol was required to facilitate the exchange of information between two platforms. We proposed the data exchange project and launched pilots in the aforementioned sites. After implementation, curators completed a survey regarding their experience with our web application, resulting in an average review score of 4.5 out of a 5-point scale. A particular point of note is that our model is not limited to two platforms — it is scalable with standardized metadata and standardized communication protocols.

Two-Dimensional Composite Biomimetic Films with Wide Optical Spectrum Response and their Properties,"X. He, L. Bian, Bo Zhang, L. Ma, Bin Guo, M. Gao, Xingfa(or X.) Ma, Guang Li","Since graphene was discovered, the biomimetic materials with laminated structure (such as, shellfish) had become one of the research-hot fields. Chitosan comes from shellfish, and was considered as a very promising abundant natural biopolymer. It holds not only outstanding mechanical properties, film-forming technology and low cost, but also has good applications in environmental fields due to its excellent adsorption properties to a broad range of organic pollutants and some heavy metal ions. Preparation of biomimetic materials with laminated structure utilizing chitosan have many advantages, however, to improve functional properties of chitosan based biomimetic materials is still a great challenge. Graphene has various applications, including storage energy devices, hydrogen production with photo-catalysts, and environmental fields because of its high charge mobility and good mechanical properties. However, graphene and its oxide have difficult re-dispersion properties in fabrication of nanocomposite. In this paper, the nanosheets stacking of metal oxide and grapheme oxide with aid of chitosan was carried out. Several characterizations were examined by SEM (scanning electron microscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra. Photocatalytic tests were examined by selecting typical organic pollutants. The photoconductivity response of nanocomposite film to visible light and 808 nm laser with low-power were investigated based on interdigital electrodes of Au on flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film substrate. The results indicated that the organic-inorganic film not only had wide visible light and NIR (near-infrared) responses, but also had good removal ability to organic pollutants. The nanocomposite film also exhibited clearly photo-response to visible light and 808 nm laser.

The effects of highway development on housing prices,"O. Levkovich, J. Rouwendal, R. van Marwijk","The purpose of this research is to estimate the effects of highway development projects on the price of housing. Transportation development projects, highways in particular, improve a certain area’s accessibility but also increase its levels of exposure to traffic intensity and noise pollution. These externalities are evaluated by homeowners and residents and are reflected in the price of housing. In this paper, we use several repeat sales model specifications, including difference-in-differences estimators, and control for neighborhood effects to examine housing price trends in the municipalities around two newly developed highways in the Netherlands. The results of the research demonstrate that changes in accessibility result in a significant positive effect on the price of housing in nearby municipalities, but that increased noise pollution and traffic intensity levels result in a decrease in prices. The findings also confirm that combining the total effects of all externalities, the effect of highway development on the price of housing is generally positive, and this effect is salient even before the project is completed due to public anticipation effects.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faf0bed52a68564111e7226e8e35b2d3c30dcff2,faf0bed52a68564111e7226e8e35b2d3c30dcff2,effect highway development housing price,"O.

Human factors and ergonomics in home care: Current concerns and future considerations for health information technology.,"C. Or, R. Valdez, G. Casper, P. Carayon, L. Burke, P. Brennan, B.

This situation brings with it a host of human factors and ergonomic (HFE) concerns, both for the home care nurse and the home dwelling patient, that can affect quality of care and patient safety. Many of these concerns are related to the critical home care tasks of information access, communication, and patient self-monitoring and self-management. Currently, a variety of health information technologies (HITs) are being promoted as possible solutions to those problems, but those same technologies bring with them a new set of HFE concerns.

Characterization of cervigram image sharpness using multiple self-referenced measurements and random forest classifiers,"Mayoore S. Jaiswal, M. Horning, Liming Hu, Yau Ben-Or, Cary R. Champlin, Ben Wilson, D. Levitz","Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide and is especially prevalent in low resource settings due to lack of screening and treatment options. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is a widespread and cost-effective screening method for cervical pre-cancer lesions, but accuracy depends on the experience level of the health worker. Digital cervicography, capturing images of the cervix, enables review by an off-site expert or potentially a machine learning algorithm. These reviews require images of sufficient quality. However, image quality varies greatly across users. A novel algorithm was developed to evaluate the sharpness of images captured with the MobileODT’s digital cervicography device (EVA System), in order to, eventually provide feedback to the health worker. The key challenges are that the algorithm evaluates only a single image of each cervix, it needs to be robust to the variability in cervix images and fast enough to run in real time on a mobile device, and the machine learning model needs to be small enough to fit on a mobile device’s memory, train on a small imbalanced dataset and run in real-time. In this paper, the focus scores of a preprocessed image and a Gaussian-blurred version of the image are calculated using established methods and used as features. A feature selection metric is proposed to select the top features which were then used in a random forest classifier to produce the final focus score. The resulting model, based on nine calculated focus scores, achieved significantly better accuracy than any single focus measure when tested on a holdout set of images. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.9459.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56f33cdb201611827b620aafd111dc7bb0730ada,56f33cdb201611827b620aafd111dc7bb0730ada,characterization cervigram image sharpness using multiple self-referenced measurement random forest classifier,"Mayoore S.

A Critical Overview on the Extraction of Bioactive Compounds from Phaleria macrocarpa (Thymelaceae),"Alara Or, Olalere Oa","Medicinal importance of many plants has drawn the attention of researchers to focus on unveiling their therapeutic molecules. Approximately, 25% of the commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants. The World Health Organization has highlighted that many plants in the world have been discovered to possess high medicinal value. The presence of large amounts of polysaccharides, polyphenols, hydrosable tannins and other secondary metabolites makes these plants to be medicinal. Moreover, the plants may contain simple phenolic compounds, phenolic acids, coumarin, flavonoids, stilbenes, hydrosable and condensed tannins, lignin and lignans.

Improved k-nearest neighbors approach for incomplete and contaminated gene expression datasets,"M. Asifuzzaman, H. Akter, M. Rashid, M. Mollah, S. Islam, M. Shahjaman","With the rapid development of high-throughput DNA microarray technologies, researchers can measure expression profiles of thousands of genes simultaneously with low costs. These massive amounts of gene expression (GE) data often contain missing values or outliers due to various reasons of data generating process. Most of the statistical methods were developed based on complete dataset. As a result, for subsequent analysis using incomplete dataset, these methods strongly suffer and we cannot find our target. A numerous methods have been developed to impute missing values and they are available in the literature. Albeit, missing values imputation and outliers handling both are equally important for analyzing GE, most of the methods perform these tasks separately and produce misleading results. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt is made to develop a new hybrid approach which is robust against outliers and missing values, simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a comparison of popular missing value imputation method K-NN while performing feature selection using both simulated and real GE datasets. The Results obtain from simulated as well as real data studies show that the proposed method outperforms K-NN in presence of different percentages of missing values and outliers. On the other hand, in absence of outliers with missing values, the proposed method keeps equal performance with the other methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32d37858e74eaac15fdc549e7dc75d1460836128,32d37858e74eaac15fdc549e7dc75d1460836128,improved k-nearest neighbor approach incomplete contaminated gene expression datasets,"M.

[Conversion ratio between different botulinum neuroprotein product in neurological practice].,"Orlova Or, Timerbaeva Sl, Khat'kova Se, E. Kostenko, D. A. Krasavina, D. Zakharov","Despite nearly 30 years of experience in the application of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) in clinical practice, many fundamental questions of therapy remain valid. There are 5 botulinum toxin type A used for neurological indications in the Russian Federation in 2017. They contain different number of active neuroprotein (150 kDa) in a therapeutic dose of the drug that may have a potential impact on the efficacy and duration of action. The current SmPC of each BTA stated that the unit of activity is unique and can not be compared with any other BTA. In scientific publications one can find many details concerning the equivalence doses of onabotulinumtoxin A (botox) and abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) and the ratio of units varies from 1:1 to 1:11. However, according to clinical guidelines, systematic reviews and high quality research evidence of recent years, the ratio of units of abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) and onabotulinumtoxin A (botox) is 3(2,5):1. Use of a fixed ratio of units is possible only when switching from one drug to another or in case of limiting access to specific drug. Botulinum toxin type A is the first line of therapy in the treatment of several neurological diseases. The most commonly used drugs of botulinum toxin type A (botox, dysport, xeomin) have a significant evidence base that confirms their efficacy and optimal safety profile.

Leadership Styles as Predictors of Work Attitudes: A Moderated–Mediation Link,"Shkoler Or, Israel Independent researcher, Aharon Tziner","Drawing on the recent locus and mechanism models of leadership (Eberly, Johnson, Hernandez & Avolio, 2013), the purpose of this paper is to begin to explore the role of leadership styles from two different loci standpoints – (1) dyadic-focused, transformational leadership; and (2) leader-focused, transactional leadership—as important antecedents to individual and organizational outcomes in the organizational context. Among employees in several organizations in Israel (N=265), we investigated the relationships between (1) several individual and organizational work outcomes (i.e., job engagement, work enjoyment); and (2) the two leadership styles (the predictors, namely, transformational and transactional leadership). In addition, we explored the roles of (3) a possible mediational mechanism through which we posited the leadership styles operate (i.e., work drive); and (4) a possible moderator (i.e., organization types). These associations were presented as a model that was both tested via multi-group moderation structural equation modeling (SEM) and through moderated–mediation analyses via competing models of demographical differences. The findings illustrated that both transformational and transactional leadership styles have a direct, positive influence on outcomes. However, with regard to the intermediary moderator and mediator variables, the results demonstrate varied and interesting relationships in current study, the indication being that each of the two leadership styles, when interfacing with unique combinations of moderator and mediator, produce outcomes specific to the leadership style.

We have identified the potential for critical synergy across data, software, hardware, locations, and content that -- if prioritized over the next decade -- will drive discovery in astronomical research. Planetariums can and should be used for the advancement of scientific research. Current facilities such as the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco, the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome Research Consortium in Cape Town, and Visualization Center C in Norrkoping are already developing software which ingests catalogs of astronomical and multi-disciplinary data critical for exploration research primarily for the purpose of creating scientific storylines for the general public. We propose a transformative model whereby scientists become the audience and explorers in planetariums, utilizing software for their own investigative purposes. In this manner, research benefits from the authentic and unique experience of data immersion contained in an environment bathed in context and equipped for collaboration.

"Unfolding Communities: Imaging the Past, Envisioning the Future","Moshe Caine, Eyal Tagar, Idit Ben Or","This paper describes an ongoing project which is ideological in its vision, anthropological and historical in its research and technological in its application. It outlines a model for cross cultural documentation and analysis of lost communities through a combination of 'hands on' and advanced imaging technologies. The rationale underlining the project is that through joint activity, discourse and discovery, widely differing groups can forge a common ground and gain a better understanding of the other. 
 
The pilot project outlined here describes a venture involving the participation of students from Israel and Germany in restoring a cemetery of the lost Jewish community of Bad Neustadt in Northern Bavaria. The paper introduces the conceptual background of cemeteries in various cultures. It then presents the case study of the Bad Neustadt project and continues with the various technological and methodological approaches to the application of advanced photographic and imaging technologies in observation, investigation, documentation and dissemination of the content. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this model may act as a template for future cross cultural collaborations of a technical, academic and social nature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eef400d9fa2f5dcbaa648634cb3161623b807868,eef400d9fa2f5dcbaa648634cb3161623b807868,unfolding community imaging past envisioning future,"Moshe Caine, Eyal Tagar, Idit Ben Or",paper describes ongoing project ideological vision anthropological historical research technological application outline model cross cultural documentation analysis lost community combination 'hands advanced imaging technology rationale underlining project joint activity discourse discovery widely differing group forge common ground gain better understanding pilot project outlined describes venture involving participation student israel germany restoring cemetery lost jewish community bad neustadt northern bavaria paper introduces conceptual background cemetery various culture present case study bad neustadt project continues various technological methodological approach application advanced photographic imaging technology observation investigation documentation dissemination content paper concludes suggestion model may act template future cross cultural collaboration technical academic social nature,unfolding community imaging past envisioning future paper describes ongoing project ideological vision anthropological historical research technological application outline model cross cultural documentation analysis lost community combination 'hands advanced imaging technology rationale underlining project joint activity discourse discovery widely differing group forge common ground gain better understanding pilot project outlined describes venture involving participation student israel germany restoring cemetery lost jewish community bad neustadt northern bavaria paper introduces conceptual background cemetery various culture present case study bad neustadt project continues various technological methodological approach application advanced photographic imaging technology observation investigation documentation dissemination content paper concludes suggestion model may act template future cross cultural collaboration technical academic social nature,-1,-1_research_study_paper_analysis

On the Substitutability of the Third-Person Perception,"Nurit Tal-Or, Y. Tsfati","The prevailing explanation for the Third-Person Perception (TPP) argues that people perceive that others are more influenced by the mass media than themselves in order to maintain a positive self image. If the TPP is indeed a self-preserving bias, then according to psychological research, it should be substitutable with other self-preserving mechanisms. However, past attempts to reduce the TPP after affirming the self have by and large failed. The studies reported in this paper extend these past attempts in two important ways. First, unlike past research that focused on cross-domain substitutability, we test for the substitutability of the TPP within a specific self-domain. Second, unlike past research that manipulated state self-esteem and measured the impact on subsequent TPPs, we also test for the opposite type of substitutability, namely for the impact of the TPP on subsequent self-maintenance mechanisms. Overall, the findings suggest that the TPP is partly substitutable with other self-preserving mechanisms, but this substitutability takes place only within a specific self-domain.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f227a8702b070501eb951ee0b8cbc591742e5ad,3f227a8702b070501eb951ee0b8cbc591742e5ad,substitutability third-person perception,"Nurit Tal, Y.

Proceedings of the 14th Eurographics workshop on Rendering,"P. Dutré, Frank Suykens, Per H. Christensen, D. Cohen-Or","This book contains the proceedings of the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2003 which took place 25-27 June 2003 in Leuven, Belgium. This event is the successor to the highly successful Eurographics Workshops on Rendering held in the previous 13 years. The workshops have become the premier forum dedicated to research in rendering, and ideas first presented at the workshops are now used in commercial products and have inspired much new research. The name change from ""workshop"" to ""symposium"" is intended to reflect the size and format of the event, and the quality of the presented research. As in previous years, we expect these proceedings to become an invaluable resource for rendering researchers and practitioners.We received a total of 81 submissions for the symposium. Each paper was carefully reviewed by two members of the international programme committee and by at least two external reviewers. The programme committee consisted of 31 rendering experts from 13 countries, and we drew upon a total of 133 highly qualified external reviewers to further ensure a thorough and fair review process. The paper submission and review process was fully electronic, with the exception of a few video tapes.The quality of the submitted papers was very high, forcing the committee members to make some difficult decisions. Due to time and space constraints, we could only accept 30 papers, and they appear here. There is a separate colour section at the end of this book with colour figures from the papers. Full-colour papers as well as supplemental material can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM.The rendering research represented in this book covers a wide spectrum. There are papers on global illumination, light fields, shadows, visibility, textures, tone mapping, filtering, colours, reflection, perception, cloth, inverse rendering, non-photorealistic rendering, and much more. Many of the papers are concerned with real-time rendering. We were pleased to have Dirk Callaerts from Eyetronics, Alex Wuttke from Double Negative, and David Kirk from NVIDIA as invited speakers, and abstracts of their talks are included in this book.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32e6b25e9990a31541b5932b1502b572fd262e60,32e6b25e9990a31541b5932b1502b572fd262e60,proceeding 14th eurographics workshop rendering,"P.

The main objective of the study is to determine the relationships between brand physical attributes, buyer behaviour, market pre-testing strategy, product adoption, marketing planning policy and competitive edge of SMEs products in Ado-odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State, Nigeria. The research design is the descriptive survey and data were gathered through a well-structured questionnaire rated on a 6-point Likert scale of Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. The population of the study comprised 240 ownermanagers and employees of selected companies presumed to host most of the SMEs in the state. The simple random sampling technique was used to select a sample of 150 individuals. 134 copies of the questionnaire were returned and analyzed using the percentile and simple regression statistical techniques. The study reveals that physical attributes of SMEs products have significant weak relationship with buyer behaviour (R=0.333; p<0.05); there is significant moderate relationship between market pre-testing strategy and adoption of product (R=0.342; p<0.05) and there is significant but weak relationship between marketing planning policy and improve competitive edge of SMEs products (R=0.125, p<0.05).

Methods: Eight centers participated, reviewing a total of 90 patients harboring 133 tumors. Prior treatments included embolization (n = 8), chemotherapy (n=2), and fractionated radiotherapy (n=34). The median tumor volume at the time of SRS was 4.9 ml (range 0.2-42.4 ml). WHO-grade II (typical) HPC’s formed 78.9% (n=71) of the cohort. The median margin and maximal doses delivered were 15 Gy (2.8-24) and 32 Gy (8-51), respectively. The median clinical and radiographic follow-up period was 59 months (6-190) and 59 months (6-183), respectively. Results: At last follow-up, 55% of tumors and 62.2% of patients demonstrated local tumor control. New remote intracranial tumors were found in 27.8%. 24.4% of patients developed extra-cranial metastases. Adverse radiation effects were noted in 6.7%. The overall survival was 91.5%, 82.1%, 73.9%, 56.7%, and 53.7% at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively, after initial SRS. Local progression free survival was 81.7%, 66.3%, 54.5%, 37.2%, and 25.5% at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively, after initial SRS. In our cohort, 32 patients underwent 48 repeat SRS procedures for 76 lesions. Margin dose greater than 16 Gy (p=0.037) and tumor histology (p=0.006) were shown to influence PFS. Conclusions: SRS provides a reasonable rate of local tumor control and a low risk of adverse effects",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d68ab9ee80f7c8f23481c963e27ecfc6b9a149c,4d68ab9ee80f7c8f23481c963e27ecfc6b9a149c,pc3 138 stereotactic radiosurgery intracranial hemangiopericytomas – multicenter study,O.

Congestion Avoidance and Fair Event Detection in Wireless Sensor Network,"Md. Mamun-Or-Rashid, M. Alam, M. Razzaque, C. Hong","Summary Congestion in WSN increases the energy dissipation rates of sensor nodes as well as the loss of packets and thereby hinders fair and reliable event detection. We find that one of the key reasons of congestion in WSN is allowing sensing nodes to transfer as many packets as possible. This is due to the use of CSMA/CA that gives opportunistic medium access control. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient congestion avoidance protocol that includes source count based hierarchical and load adaptive medium access control and weighted round robin packet forwarding. We also propose in-node fair packet scheduling to achieve fair event detection. The results of simulation show our scheme exhibits more than 90% delivery ratio even under bursty traffic condition which is good enough for reliable event perception. Key words: Sensor Network, Congestion Avoidance, Hierarchical Medium Access, Fair Event Detection. 1. Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are densely deployed for a wide range of applications in the military, health, environment, agriculture and smart office domain. These networks deliver numerous types of traffic, from simple periodic reports to unpredictable bursts of packets triggered by sensed events. Therefore, congestion happens due to contention caused by concurrent transmissions, buffer overflows and time varying wireless channel condition [1][2][3]. As WSN is a multi-hop network, congestion taking place at a single node may diffuse to the whole network and degrades its performance drastically [4]. Congestion causes many folds of drawbacks: (i) it increases energy dissipation rates of sensor nodes, (ii) it causes a lot of packet loss, which in turn diminish the network throughput, and (iii) it hinders fair event detections and reliable data transmissions. Therefore, congestion avoidance and fair packet delivery become a crucial research issue for the practical realization of WSN based envisioned applications.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/757c92a41495fcfd66723c657bb8cf2a2dc39236,757c92a41495fcfd66723c657bb8cf2a2dc39236,congestion avoidance fair event detection wireless sensor network,"Md.

A biologically inspired CPG-ZMP control system for the real-time balance of a single-legged belly dancing robot,"Jimmy Or, A. Takanishi","Recently, a few researchers have started to realize that in order for humanoid robots to move more naturally, it is necessary for them to incorporate a flexible spine in their robots. So far, nobody has come out with a solution which allows their spine robots to maintain balance in real-time. This paper presents a biologically inspired, hybrid CPG-ZMP controller for a single-legged, flexible spine belly dancing robot. Using only two control parameters, our robot can generate rhythmic and wave-like spine motions through the CPG component. By monitoring the torque at the robot's ankle, the ZMP component allows the robot to maintain balance in real-time. Unlike traditional ZMP-based controllers, no modeling of the robot's dynamics or explicit computations of the zero moment point are required. The resultant robot's motions emerge automatically in real-time through dynamic interactions between the robot, its neural network and the environment. Experimental results indicate that our controller has the potential to be applied to a new generation of flexible spine, biped walking humanoid robots.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/659ebdff34ddf9215f988a27acca4328b6837f10,659ebdff34ddf9215f988a27acca4328b6837f10,biologically inspired cpg-zmp control system real-time balance single-legged belly dancing robot,"Jimmy Or, A.

On the hybrid dynamics of planar mechanisms supported by frictional contacts. I: necessary conditions for stability,"Y. Or, E. Rimon","This paper is concerned with the stability of planar mechanisms supported by multiple frictional contacts against gravity. Stability of equilibrium postures is investigated under initial perturbations which may involve sliding or separation at the contacts. The frictional dynamics is formulated using the notion of contact modes, and the related problems of solution ambiguity and inconsistency are reviewed. The paper then uses the condition of strong equilibrium to eliminate ambiguities, and defines a new condition of kinematic-strong equilibrium which additionally eliminates frictional inconsistencies. It is then proven that strong equilibrium is necessary for stability of frictional equilibrium postures, and that kinematic-strong equilibrium guarantees finite-time recovery of an initially perturbed contact. The results are demonstrated on a reduced model of a rigid body having a variable center-of-mass and supported by two frictional contacts. A companion paper completes the analysis of this reduced problem by investigating the overall hybrid dynamics and deriving sufficient conditions for its stability.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fbd2f1278ae9744d4f90b4934d76b48564f556bd,fbd2f1278ae9744d4f90b4934d76b48564f556bd,hybrid dynamic planar mechanism supported frictional contact necessary condition stability,"Y.

Trainability of the Prepubescent Child.,"O. Bar-or, B.

Thus studies of this group must carefully equate the training dose and include a control group. The research reviewed in this article indicates that aerobic power, muscle strength, and anaerobic muscle power are trainable. However, the degree of trainability of aerobic power seems somewhat lower in prepubescents than in more mature age-groups.

Flow and Distribution of Fluid Phases through Porous Plant Growth Media in Microgravity: Progress to Date,"S. L. Steinberg, N. Daidzic, S. Jones, D. Or, G. Kluitenberg, L. Reddi, J. Alexander, M. Tuller",Results from plant growth experiments utilizing particulate growth media during space flight revealed difficulties associated with providing reliable reproducible gaseous and water supply to plant roots. These limitations were attributed to insufficient understanding of liquid configuration and growth media transport processes in reduced gravity. The objective of this NASA-funded research program is to develop a framework for modeling and quantitative characterization of physical processes associated with flow of wetting and non-wetting phases in particulate plant growth media in microgravity. This paper provides an overview of research plans and current status of research activities. Characterization and modeling of substrate water retention and transport properties in microgravity is key to management and control of gas and liquid fluxes within plant root zones. Modeling efforts will focus on both 1) a pore network model for describing discontinuous fluid phase transport (ganglia/blobs) and 2) a statistical distribution model describing water retention and hydraulic conductivity as functions of various pore configurations. Minimizing hydrostatic forces within porous media by using thin samples on earth may provide an approximation to microgravity conditions. In our preliminary study we have used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to detect and track the evolution of liquid configuration and dynamics within thin slices of opaque porous media (Aquafoam with mean pore size of 50 μm). Both twoand three dimensional temporal MRI imaging has been performed in thin Aquafoam slices positioned vertically and horizontally (to simulate the effect of gravity).

BET 3: Pelvic circumferential compression devices for haemorrhage control: panacea or myth?,"OR Myth, M. Stewart, David Clarke","A short-cut review was carried out to establish whether pelvic immobilisation with a pelvic compression device or with a wrapped sheet would provide haemorrhage control. Four studies were relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are shown in table 3. The clinical bottom line is that both may provide some haemorrhage control, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend one over the other. THREE-PART QUESTION In (patients with unstable pelvic fractures) are (pelvic compressions devices) effective at (reducing bleeding and mortality)? CLINICAL SCENARIO You are leading the team resuscitation of a cyclist who was hit by a car. From the injury pattern you suspect she may have an open book pelvic fracture, and decide to apply a pelvic binder. One of your colleagues suggests there is no point unless the injury is shown on x-ray, and another thinks they are entirely pointless. You get the binder applied, but resolve to check the evidence before next time.

SEARCH OUTCOME Seventy-nine results were obtained using the stated search. Of these, four provided the best evidence to answer the question. COMMENTS Bleeding associated with pelvic fractures can be directly from the fractured bone, from the pre-sacral venous plexus, and from the iliac vessels. Pelvic binders have been shown to restore normal bony anatomy effectively (Knops et al, 2011). In principle, this will directly tamponade the bleeding from bone, and by reducing pelvic volume and limiting movement should also reduce venous bleeding (Simpson et al, 2002). By preventing ongoing haemorrhage, they should confer benefits to mortality and transfusion requirements. In practice it is difficult to study this. The limited clinical research has involved historical cohort studies, which could have significant bias from the overall changes in trauma care that occur between the control and study groups. The results from those studies, which have been published, are heterogeneous and therefore difficult to interpret. While Croce et al found binders to be more effective than external fixators, Ghaemmaghami et al found no benefit from their use in the early stage of trauma resuscitation. Pelvic compression has also been shown to cause local tissue damage (Schaller et al, 2005; Jowett and Boyer, 2007), and it must be remembered that this is not an entirely benign intervention. Given the limited data to show any benefit, this demonstrates a need for further research into their role.

Allogeneic cell therapy: the treatment of choice for all hematologic malignancies relapsing post BMT.,"S. Slavin, E. Naparstek, A. Nagler, Y. Kapelushnik, A. Ackerstein, R. Or","I read the article of Hans J. Kolb on behalf of the European Group for Blood and M m w Transplantation working party with great interest.’ This article attempts to summarize the present state of the art in treating relapsed leukemia following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with donor lymphocyte infusion. Ignoring previously published observations have lead the authors to a number of wrong conclusions, which must be reconsidered in view of existing data. First, the authors refer in their introduction to the first patient treated with transfusion of donor lymphocytes, quoting their own reference.’ Dr Kolb and some of his colleagues should have been aware of earlier quotations of both the concept and the first patients treated with donor lymphocyte infusions as reported in several abstracts in Blood,”-6 meeting reports,’ papers in refered journal^^^^^ and a review.” The issue is not ignoring the original observations and successful pilot clinical trials published earlier, quoting selectively one’s own, which is not infrequent among colleagues and scientists. What is even worse is the fact that the report talks clinicians away from attempting to try adoptive allogeneic cell therapy (allo-CT) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have relapsed following allogeneic BMT, although patients with ALL relapsing following allogeneic BMT were previously successfully treated with allo-CT. In fact, the first patient ever treated successfully with allo-CT, as early as November 1986, was a patient with ALL and he was the one who paved the road for using alloCT late post BMT as a potent therapeutic modality for the treatment3-6 or even prevention” of relapse in patients failing allogeneic BMT. This patient’was a 2’/2-year-old boy with a very aggressive form of pre-B cell ALL transplanted in second resistant relapse. Allo-CT was considered as soon as he relapsed again 1 month following BMT, this time with bulky extra-myeloid disease accompanying overt hematological relapse, both of which responded extremely well to repeated infusions of his sister’s peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). This patient is currently alive and well and disease-free, with negative polymerase chain reaction for male DNA, >8 years following BMT. Details of this patient were previously presented in Dr Kolb’s report at the last meeting of the International European Bone Marrow Transplantation Society. Moreover, since then successful reversal of relapse was accomplished by our team in a total of 4 out of 6 patients with ALL, in 3 only following the addition of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) concomitantly with infusion of donor PBL.’3,’4 It seems important to bring these data to the attention of Blood because in view of the conclusions of Kolb’s paper’ many hematologists may not wish to attempt treating patients with ALL relapsing following allogeneic BMT, a complication that is unfortunately not infrequent. Because no effective alternative treatment is available for patients relapsing post BMT, patients with ALL, like patients with any other hematological malignancy, should be offered the therapeutic benefits of allo-CT as soon as relapse can be diagnosed, contrary to the conclusions of Kolb’s report, preferably at the stage of minimal disease. Alternatively, considering the amount of tumor cells at the time relapse is diagnosed and the rate of tumor cell growth, before debulking by chemotherapy should be considered to permit sufficient time for the development of graft versus leukemia effects. Overall, the cumulative international experience indicates that allo-CT should be considered as the treatment of choice for treating relapse in both acute and chronic leukemia. As it appears that all tumor cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells may be susceptible to allo-CT, donor PBL infusion should be considered for the treatment of all hematological malignancies, including EBV-induced posttransplant lymphoma and most likely, although the data is not yet sufficient, for treatment of other lymphomas as well. Moreover, patients with resistant disease may still respond to allogeneic donor T lymphocytes further activated in vivo by rIL-2?’0.’’,’3 In view of the growing clinical experience, the previously described information should serve as a reminder not to give up hope and intensive therapeutic efforts when a patient relapses early or late following allogeneic BMT, because posttransplant immunotherapy may reinduce durable remission. Considering unmaintained disease-free survival extending beyond 5 years with elimination of all detectable evidence of disease or host-specific markers by sensitive molecular methods, one might dare to define the long-term remission inducible by allo-CT as complete cure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d280a784e3199abb12171eb9c7fe16c55132b055,d280a784e3199abb12171eb9c7fe16c55132b055,allogeneic cell therapy treatment choice hematologic malignancy relapsing post bmt,"S.

"A Novel Synthesis Design Approach for Continuous, Inhomogeneous Structures","O. Yogev, E. Antonsson","This paper presents a novel approach for the design synthesis of continuous inhomogeneous structures. The objective of this research is to mimic biological principles of growth and evolution in order to explore a set of novel design configurations identified by high complexity both in topology and mechanical properties. The ability to synthesize novel structures is explored from an engineering point view, where the use of inhomogeneous properties can increase the ability of a structure to support external loads and minimize weight. Based on the observation that biological structures are inhomogeneous, in the sense that different cells have different properties, an artificial environment has been created which models the biological growth procedure with cells that serve as building blocks of the structure. Cell differentiation is expressed only in the sense of mechanical properties. Each cell contains an identical artificial DNA sequence which is executed during the growth procedure and stops once the structure meets desired engineering requirements, such as supporting loads. The DNA contains sets of rules which are encoded as a gene string. A relatively simple DNA sequence can give rise to complex inhomogeneous structures; small changes in the rules can lead to a significantly different structures with different properties. The representation of these rules is ideally suited for evolution, which will be applied in the future to evolve rule-sets that grow and develop high-performance inhomogeneous structures.Copyright © 2007 by ASME",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d204a45418e1941de0304397265e253360c6a1f,0d204a45418e1941de0304397265e253360c6a1f,novel synthesis design approach continuous inhomogeneous structure,"O.

Disentangling the EMC Effect,"E. Piasetzky, O. Hen, L. Weinstein","The deep inelastic scattering cross section for scattering from bound nucleons differs from that of free nucleons.This phenomena, first discovered 30 years ago, is known as the EMC effect and is still not fully understood. Recent analysis of world data showed that the strength of the EMC effect is linearly correlated with the relative amount of Two-Nucleon Short Range Correlated pairs (2N-SRC) in nuclei. The latter are pairs of nucleons whose wave functions overlap, giving them large relative momentum and low center of mass momentum, where high and low is relative to the Fermi momentum of the nucleus. The observed correlation indicates that the EMC effect, like 2N-SRC pairs, is related to high momentum nucleons in the nucleus. This paper reviews previous studies of the EMC-SRC correlation and studies its robustness. It also presents a planned experiment aimed at studying the origin of this EMC-SRC correlation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3c3e241d9ab0844cf1a90e27b5e2d359487db2e,a3c3e241d9ab0844cf1a90e27b5e2d359487db2e,disentangling emc effect,"E.

Cost Benefit Analysis of Procurement Systems and the Performance of Construction Projects in East Malaysia,"O. Onosakponome, Azhar Yahya, Nazatul Shima Abdul Rani, Junaid M. Shaikh","This research investigated the impacts of procurement systems on the performance of construction projects in East Malaysia. Construction project outcome may be measured in terms of time, cost and quality achieved. Project clients demand and want best value for their money and they want their projects to be completed on time, within budgeted cost and at appropriate quality or specification. The sample in this research consists of 58 participants that work in a construction companies/industry. 90 questionnaires were distributed, 69 were successfully returned and 58 were fully completed. The sample comprises project clients/owners, project managers, consultants and construction workers. However, due to the fact that the time allocated for this research is limited and it is of qualitative in nature for which the sample size is less important (Kumar, 2005). The aim of using project clients, project managers, consultants and construction workers from different companies is because they work under different circumstances, which will ensure all questions are answered from different perspective. Therefore, the researcher distributed questionnaires randomly among the participants in different construction companies. This also minimises any bias towards any particular company. The key findings and conclusions from literature review and the analysis of results of questionnaires issued to project clients, projects managers, consultants and construction workers showed that traditional procurement system benefits cost and quality but at the expense of time. In other words, traditional procurement system has positive impacts on project objectives of cost and quality and negative impact on project time. Design and build procurement system benefits cost and time but at the expense of quality and this implies that the impacts of design and build procurement system on project objectives of cost and time are positive with negative impact on project quality.

Method of indirect measurement of fruiter biomass,"Hong Tiansheng, W. Weibin, Lu Zhao-qiang, Zhang Wen-zhao, Li Zhen, or initial or initial","Fruiter biomass is one of the crucial parameters for precision spraying. This paper is to research measurement method for ground-based fruiter biomass by integrating direct and virtual plant technology based on real guava. Firstly, a real guava fruiter with 274 leaves and 228 branch segments was selected and its leaves and branch segments were encoded. Secondly, the coordinates of the guava's leaves and branches were gained by 3D digitalizer named Fastrak produced by Phohelmes and then a virtual guava model with a virtual direct beam environment was built by VC++ with OpenGL. Meanwhile, the guava's leaf parameters such as length, area, wet weight, and dry weight and branch segment parameters such as length, diameter, wet weight, and dry weight were measured by direct methods. Hereinto, a kind of useful leaf area process method was outlined for dealing area detection with different sides and holes .Using a kind of shadowing method, virtual guava could be shadowed in different horizontal height or in different vertical width and its shaded area, total biomass and so forth in different layers were calculated by integrating real guava's parameters. After regression analysis using SPSS, for the real guava the R2 between total leaf area and leaf dry weight is beyond 0.988 with the near regression formula between direct method and virtual plant method, the R2 between total leaf dry weight and branch dry weight is 0.89, the R2 between branch diameter and leaf dry weight is 0.80, the R2 between branch D2H(diameter's square multiply height) and leaf dry weight is 0.97. And in the virtual fruiter, the R2 between leaf area and leaf dry weight is beyond 0.95, which proved the relation in the real tree. Additionally, more detail relations like height and leaf area, leaf shadowed area and leaf area were analyzed in the virtual fruiter data which provided important information to build a LAI and biomass calculation model.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b4222482db5abeb3d8b80e8df7718f23ed1f771,6b4222482db5abeb3d8b80e8df7718f23ed1f771,method indirect measurement fruiter biomass,"Hong Tiansheng, W.

Adaptation in Agriculture for Global Climate Management,"C. Ouellet-Plamondon, or initial or initial","--------Abstract. This paper presents an overview of global climate management practices in agriculture in response to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and the Kyoto Protocol. Agriculture is a significant net contributor to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) -- nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2). At the same time, agriculture is affected by the global rise in temperature, change in precipitation patterns and extreme weather events. To remain sustainable, agriculture must limit its impact on the global climate. The Kyoto Protocol was placed into effect February 2005. Clean development mechanism (CDM) is a flexible mechanism to reduce emission. --In agriculture, it is recognized that more work is needed to propose simplified guidelines and methodologies for small scale CDM projects. Methane recovery projects and avoidance of methane production are treated separately. Recent research summarizes global measures to agriculture including improvement of feed digestibility and rice paddy management to decrease methane emission, utility of soil as carbon sink, control of N--fertilizer application, land management, and pest and disease control. As bio--ethanol production as an alternative to the use of fossil fuel creates a demand on agricultural land, the Brazilian, American and Chinese approaches are compared. Management practices in agriculture include ecological management, hierarchical analysis, emissions balance, and climatic data management. Beyond 2012, deeper reductions in global emissions will be required. A reconstruction of the problem in the framework of biocapacity and ecological footprint can stimulate problem solving.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f8c8206a5c41133b297719e1f48907ac6277078,9f8c8206a5c41133b297719e1f48907ac6277078,adaptation agriculture global climate management,"C.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation in Multiple Sclerosis (IN8-2.003),"Jeffrey A. Cohen, A. Bar-Or, R. Bermel, E. Fisher, R. Fox, S. Gerson, P. Imrey, H. Lazarus, S. Planchon, J. Reese, Cynthia Schwanger, T. Skaramagas","Objective: To describe the design and progress of an ongoing Phase 1 group-sequential trial of autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Background MSCs have potent immunomodulatory, tissue-protective, and repair-promoting properties in vitro and in animal models. Clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of MSC transplantation in a number of human conditions. Published experience in MS is modest. Design/Methods: 24 participants with relapsing forms of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0-6.5, clinical or MRI activity in the prior 2 years, and optic nerve involvement will be enrolled. Bone-marrow-derived MSCs are culture-expanded in DMEM / 10% fetal bovine serum / 10 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor-2 then cryopreserved. After confirmation of release criteria, 1-2x10^6 MSCs/kg are administered IV. The primary outcomes are feasibility, safety, and tolerability with Data Safety Monitoring Committee review after every 4 participants. Exploratory efficacy endpoints comparing 2 months pre-infusion and 6 months post-infusion include relapses, disability (EDSS, MS Functional Composite, low-contrast letter acuity), MRI (T2 lesions, T1 lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, whole brain and gray matter atrophy, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetization transfer imaging), optical coherence tomography, visual evoked potentials, and patient self-reported health status. Ancillary immunologic mechanistic studies utilizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated at several pre- and post-infusion timepoints assess lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry, T-cell responses to myelin antigens, and T-cell and B-cell regulatory functions. In vitro studies assess the mechanisms of MSC-induced immunomodulation and compare MSC-PBMC interactions in MS patients vs. controls. Results: 4 participants have been infused to date. Culture duration was 21-41 days, yielding cell doses for administration of 2x10^6 MSCs/kg (n=2) and 1.5x10^6 MSCs/kg (n=2). MSC cultures for 2 additional participants are in progress.

Pair Modeling with DynaLearn - Students' Attitudes and Actual Effects,"R. Or-Bach, B. Bredeweg","With DynaLearn learners can construct scientific knowledge by manipulating icons and their inter-relationships, using a diagrammatic representation. The diagrams represent models that can be simulated, confronting learners with the logical consequences of the knowledge they expressed. Such modeling activities are highly advocated by science educators. Learning from the construction and debugging processes of modeling can be enhanced by collaboration. The modeling elements can serve as anchors for discussing, justifying, and explaining the model. Researchers have suggested various ways of supporting collaboration. In this study we employed Pair Modeling, which is an adaptation of the pair programming technique that is used for enhancing collaborative programming both in the industry and in academia. In this paper we present encouraging results for the use of this collaboration technique based on assignments’ scores, observations, and a questionnaire. Students’ attitudes were neutral on the average, but the average score of the group that employed Pair Modeling was significantly higher than the average score of the control group that employed unstructured pair collaboration. We discuss the implications of the obtained results and the limitations of the study.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/648bb7289dabe13f34492109c08a328426819fe8,648bb7289dabe13f34492109c08a328426819fe8,pair modeling dynalearn student attitude actual effect,"R.

"A Synthesis of Grice-Strawson‟s, and Putnam‟s Arguments in Defence of the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction",Or Taye,"Critical debates on the analytic- synthetic distinction1 started with W. V. Quine. He questioned all the grounds upon which the analytic-synthetic distinction is founded. After his critical assessment of the grounds upon which the purported distinction is based, he found out that all these grounds are not sufficient to justify the distinction. He then declared the analytic-synthetic distinction unjustified. Grice and Strawson, Putnam, and other proponents of the distinction have made serious attempts to defend it. This paper critically researches into the arguments of the opponents of Quine with a view to assessing the strength and weaknesses and then come out with a synthesis of the arguments.

Observations on the Desirability of an Enhanced International Legal Status of the Non-State Actor,N. Gal‐Or,"This paper arises out of two main observations regarding the rights and obligations of Non-State Actors (NSAs) under international law. First, there is considerable disagreement as to what the position of the NSA is, (Bianchi 2009; Reinisch 2009) and should be, under international law; and second - flowing from that and from the fragmented state of international law - that there is an urgent doctrinal (Carty 2006 ) need for an integrated and comprehensive assessment of the status of the NSA in international law. Because it is indisputable that the NSA has already been recognised as enjoying a set of rights and being bound by certain obligations in international law, this paper will investigate the desirability of charting international legal development towards further enhancement of the legal status already secured by the NSA. Undeniably, legal status in international law hinges on the elusive concept of international legal personality (ILP), a matter “negated” (Nijman 2004) for long yet enjoying gradual renewal. This is a normative, and of course, political, question. The paper, however, does not explore the value of an NSA’s enhanced legal status; rather, it brings forward a proposal outlining how to examine the essence of an NSA’s legal status and its “weight” in international law. Such knowledge is invaluable for the maintenance of consistency and coherence in a fast transforming and developing international law. (Frank 1995; Hart 1994) Also, it is important to note that our focus is not on whether or not a specific NSA should or should not be recognised as a subject of international law. Rather, the purpose of this paper is to propose how to explore three fundamental questions from a doctrinal perspective because, as eloquently observed, “[in] a world where there is no want of information [...] somewhat paradoxically, doctrine may still mediate, no longer between primary sources and their potential users but, rather, between secondary sources and interested readers,” (Bianchi 2009:xii) and all the more so, where the subject matter is still suffering from lack of systematic scrutiny (Bianchi 2009; de Brabandere 2009). The first question is whether the NSA should be recognised as a general category of an actor. Specifically, should the NSA be considered as consisting of a “garden variety” of various types of actors akin to the State, and to which a fundamental unitary set of rights and obligations in international law applies? Consequently, the second question is whether the NSA - as a general category or as several single types of NSAs - should be considered a subject of international law equal to the State and consequently recognised as bound by the identical and full set of rights and obligations pertaining to the State? Thirdly, should the rights and obligations of the State be adjusted to accommodate the legal status needs (and gains) of the NSA? In other words, would it be desirable to break out from the current doctrinal paradigm of international law? In reference to the dictum of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that ""[t]he subjects of law in any legal system are not necessarily identical in their nature or in the extent of their rights, and their nature depends upon the needs of the community"" (Reparation 1949, emphases added), another question arises: Would the NSA’s interests and needs - at both domestic and international realms - be more appropriate satisfied by applying municipal, rather than international, legal standards? If so, then equality before international law, between international actors, would not require their equality under international law. Following a discussion on the meaning of “legal status” and international law, the methodology regarding how to answer the above questions will be addressed from two angles. First, stock is taken of the current state of the art regarding the status of the NSA in international law and the conditions requisite for possession of ILP including an observation concerning as well as a discussion on the viability of a doctrinal general category of NSA. An analytical model to serve as methodological tools for further research will be presented. This examination is followed by the question of whether further changes to the legal status of the NSA are likely to enhance the development of international law. Accordingly, it is suggested to conduct this inquiry by exploring whether international law passes the test of the NSA challenge to the extant doctrine.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48a912dc8ab08dffa68929a210ee3f39f7f3f5e8,48a912dc8ab08dffa68929a210ee3f39f7f3f5e8,observation desirability enhanced international legal status non-state actor,N.

Unconventional journals: protect nonconformists.,Or Syd Amit,"### Take the Poll

The non–peer-reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses considers [“radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas.”][1] Recently, the journal has drawn fire for publishing papers that some say are detrimental to health care efforts (see [Letter by G. N. Vyas][2]); others feel that the journal is a “refreshing source of independent thinking” (see this Letter). The future of Medical Hypotheses is now unclear. What do you think?

In general, do the benefits of a journal such as Medical Hypotheses outweigh the risks? Take the poll at [www.sciencemag.org/extra/polls/20100423-1.dtl][3] .

I was dismayed to learn that Elsevier intends to remove Bruce Charlton as editor-in-chief of the journal Medical Hypotheses and to convert the journal to peer-review format (“Elsevier to editor: Change controversial journal or resign,” M. Enserink, 12 March, p. [1316][4]). I find Medical Hypotheses to be a refreshing source of independent thinking in a sphere of scientific publishing that is becoming increasingly conformist, repetitive, and sometimes outright boring.

The current controversy around Medical Hypotheses —anger over papers claiming that HIV does not cause AIDS—highlights a major threat to the future of independent scientific thinking. The scientific community is undergoing continual division into exclusive clubs whose members are hostile to outsiders and their ideas. Nonconformists find it increasingly difficult to receive funding, secure tenure, and publish their hypotheses and results. This is particularly true in medical and biomedical research.

Underlying this trend is the unfortunate fact that increasing specialization has led many scientists to dedicate their entire careers to very narrow lines of research. These scientists may see their careers crumble should the theoretical framework underlying their research become unstable. Consequently, they have strong incentives to keep paradigm-shifting ideas away from the limelight. Medical Hypotheses was established to give an outlet to these potentially revolutionary ideas.

The hysteria surrounding the controversial HIV paper is particularly alarming, and some of the measures suggested, such as canceling Medical Hypotheses subscriptions and removing it from the MEDLINE database, are outright draconian. Those who claim to be scientists should use facts and reason, not censorship, to refute opposing views. This resort to censorship underscores the indispensable role of Medical Hypotheses as an outlet for new and challenging thoughts.

Forcing Medical Hypotheses to submit to peer reviews would turn it into yet another establishment journal, thus depriving it of its essence and uniqueness. It might as well be renamed Mundane Hypotheses .

Dispute Resolution in International Trade and Investment Law: Privatisation of the Public?,N. Gal‐Or,"Global trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) have figured as two most critical facilitators in the communication and knowledge revolution beginning in the mid 1970s. Changes in these economic sectors effected transformations in known and accepted international - and even domestic - rules of the game. They are challenging basic assumptions regarding the three pillars of governance: Law making, law adjudication, and law enforcement, and have brought international law into a swirl. It is now time to bring some theoretical and principled order into what has been born out of economic, political, and legal empirical experimentation. Within this anthology on transnational private governance (TPG), this paper concentrates on the international legal ramifications of the privatisation of areas formerly under public governance. I argue here that - important as they are to the clarifications of the legal and governance practises at the international and national levels - the discourses on the legalisation, judicialization, and constitutionalization of international relations rarely reach beyond the classic paradigm of public versus private international law. And where exploring the overlap between these two spheres, they remain confined to symptomatic issues. For example, the debates address public’s demand for transparency and private sector’s need for confidentiality, or identify new private actors in international relations, yet without tackling the varying challenges these actors pose for public international law. Who are the new actors in international relations? Who is, and who can and should, be recognised as subject of international law? Why, and for what purpose? In other words, in the face of devolution and convergence of governance formats, can the state continue to be the primary (in most cases - the sole) subject of international law? Can it survive the empirical evolutions? If not, what are the rights and obligations that new international NSAs enjoy and must be bound by as new de facto subjects of international law? Who among these actors can and should be recognised as subject of international law? For whatever reason (deterred by the complexity, or simple inattention), scholars have refrained from directly - and prescriptively - tackling this core issue, missing the point, and neglecting to “think the issue through”. In the paper, I trace the impact of the private sector on the public sphere by reviewing the major legal and political debates arising from the developments in global trade and investment. I exemplify this by referring to the 3d draft of the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) as a case study representative of a revolutionary trend in the development in international trade and investment law. I show that in order to contribute to a coherent, relevant, and legitimate international legal system, each polemic must as a primary condition of clarification tackle the identity of subject of international law. The first part of the paper discusses the private-public nexus in regards to trade and investment and its reflection in international law. It is followed by an analysis of the intersection between the private and public in the course of the development of international trade and investment law and asks the question whether the public is co-opting the private sector, or vice versa. This part, which forms the core of the paper is further divided in to sections examining whether trade and investment agreements are treaties or contracts and analysing their dispute settlement mechanisms by means of a sample of the most pressing problems: Privity of contract, juridicialization of arbitration, the meaning of appeal, the enforcement of international arbitral awards, and the question about the need for specialised legal institutions. The paper concludes with a call for a transdisciplinary discourse on the identity and definition of subject of international law.

"Influence of Habitat Modifications on Habitat Composition and Anadromous Salmonid Populations in Fish Creek, Oregon, 1983-1988 Annual Report.","G. Reeves, Corvallis Or Range Experiment Station, David B. Hohler","Modification of degraded habitats to increase populations of anadromous salmonids is a major focus of management agencies throughout the Pacific Northwest. Millions of dollars are spent annually on such efforts. Inherent in implementing habitat improvements is the need for quantitative evaluation of the biological and physical effects of such work. Reeves et al. (in press), however, noted that such evaluations are rare, making it difficult to assess the true results of habitat work. While it is not economically possible to thoroughly evaluate every habitat project, it is essential that intensive evaluations be done on selected representative projects. One such evaluation program has been underway since 1982 on Fish Creek, a tributary of the Clackamas River near Estacada, OR. Habitat modification has been done by the USDA Forest Service, Estacada Ranger District, Mt. Hood National Forest with funding provided in part by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The USDA Forest Service, Anadromous Fish Habitat Research Unit, Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW), Corvallis, OR is charged with: (1) evaluating the biological and physical responses to habitat modifications on a basin scale; and (2) developing a cost-benefit analysis of the program. Preliminary results have been reported in a series of annual publications, Everestmore » and Sedell 1983, 1984 and Everest et al. 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) report 1988 observations of biological and physical changes in habitat, salmonid populations, and smolt production in Fish Creek, and (2) examine preliminary trends in fish habitat and populations related to habitat improvement over the period 1983-1988. We have prefaced the trends in the latter objective as preliminary because we believe it could take a minimum of 10 years before the full biological and physical responses to habitat work are realized. We therefore urge caution in interpreting these preliminary results.« less",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/731a7bdf1b26c6e6497af8dfa72c45c9d1209663,731a7bdf1b26c6e6497af8dfa72c45c9d1209663,influence habitat modification habitat composition anadromous salmonid population fish creek oregon 1983-1988 annual report,"G.

 A thorough understanding of neutrino–nucleus scattering physics is crucial for the successful execution of the entire US neutrino physics program. Neutrino–nucleus interaction constitutes one of the biggest systematic uncertainties in neutrino experiments—both at intermediate energies affecting long-baseline deep underground neutrino experiment, as well as at low energies affecting coherent scattering neutrino program—and could well be the difference between achieving or missing discovery level precision. To this end, electron–nucleus scattering experiments provide vital information to test, assess and validate different nuclear models and event generators intended to test, assess and validate different nuclear models and event generators intended to be used in neutrino experiments. Similarly, for the low-energy neutrino program revolving around the coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEvNS) physics at stopped pion sources, such as at ORNL, the main source of uncertainty in the evaluation of the CEvNS cross section is driven by the underlying nuclear structure, embedded in the weak form factor, of the target nucleus. To this end, parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) experiments, utilizing polarized electron beams, provide vital model-independent information in determining weak form factors. This information is vital in achieving a percent level precision needed to disentangle new physics signals from the standard model expected CEvNS rate. In this white paper, we highlight connections between electron- and neutrino–nucleus scattering physics at energies ranging from 10 s of MeV to a few GeV, review the status of ongoing and planned electron scattering experiments, identify gaps, and lay out a path forward that benefits the neutrino community. We also highlight the systemic challenges with respect to the divide between the nuclear and high-energy physics communities and funding that presents additional hurdles in mobilizing these connections to the benefit of neutrino programs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b26a08956a8dc611e5dbfb5a5daf702d2eaa044,3b26a08956a8dc611e5dbfb5a5daf702d2eaa044,electron scattering neutrino physic,"A.

Lam","Introduction Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a prevalent and frequently debilitating response to a cancer diagnosis, affecting a substantial proportion of cancer survivors. Approximately 30% of local Hong Kong Chinese cancer survivors in a recent survey reportedly experienced persistent high FCR over the first-year post-surgery. This was associated with lower levels of psychological well-being and quality of life. A manualised intervention (ConquerFear) developed primarily based on the Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model and the Rational Frame Theory, has been found to reduce FCR effectively among Caucasian cancer survivors. The intervention now has been adapted to a Chinese context; ConquerFear-HK. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate its efficacy vs a standard-survivorship-care control (BasicCancerCare) in FCR improvement in a randomised control trial (RCT). Methods and analysis In this RCT, using the sealed envelope method, 174 eligible Chinese cancer survivors will be randomised to either the ConquerFear-HK or BasicCancerCare intervention. Both interventions include six sessions over 10 weeks, which will be delivered via face to face or online by trained therapists. The ConquerFear-HK intervention incorporates value classification, metacognitive therapy, attentional training, detached mindfulness and psychoeducation; BasicCancerCare includes relaxation training, dietary and physical activity consultations. Participants will be assessed at prior randomisation (baseline; T0), immediately postintervention (T1), 3 months (T2) and 6 months postintervention (T3) on the measures of FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory) as a primary outcome; metacognition (30-item Metacognitions Quesionnaire) and cognitive attentional syndrome (Cognitive-attentional Syndrome Questionnaire) as process outcomes; psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), cancer-related distress (Chinese Impact of Events Scale), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire) and treatment satisfaction are secondary outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from HKU/HA HKW Institutional Review Board (ref: UW19-183). The patients/participants provide their written informed consent to participate in this study. The study results will be disseminated through international peer-review publications and conference presentations.

Alternative clinical approaches to the treatment of pruritus related with canine atopic dermatitis,"Deniz Zeynep Telci, Semih İzmirli, M. Or, B. Dokuzeylül","Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) is a genetically inheritable, inflammatory and pruritic skin disease with characteristic clinical features, most commonly associated with IgE antibodies to environmental allergens. Itching is the most prominent clinical finding. Depending on the allergens involved, seasonal or non-seasonal pruritus may occur. 
 In the first active phase of pruritus treatment, which consists of two stages, acute exacerbations should be controlled by drugs with active ingredients such as corticosteroids, oclacitinib, lokivetmab, etc. In the proactive pruritus treatment, it is aimed to prevent exacerbations and prolong the pruritus-free period with maintenance treatment. For this purpose, in addition to active phase of the therapy, different treatment options such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, antihistamines, essential fatty acids, Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), topical drugs and shampoos can be used to repair the skin barrier. 
 Due to the side effects and costs of the drugs used in the treatment of pruritus in atopic dermatitis, researches on alternative treatment methods are still continuing. Applications such as mesenchymal stem cell therapy, recombinant canine gamma-interferon, luteolin, vitamin D, vitamin E, lactoferricin/verbascoside, mastinib, cannabidiol (CBD), probiotics and vaccination against IL-31 are the alternative treatment options for atopic dermatitis in dogs. However, more studies are needed before their inclusion in our routine clinical practices and added to the guidelines.

Prediction of Death Counts Based on Short-term Mortality Fluctuations Data Series using Multi-output Regression Models,"Md Imtiaz Ahmed, Nurjahan -, Md. Mahbub-Or-Rashid, F. Islam","—Effective public health responses to unexpected epidemiological hazards or disasters need rapid and reliable monitoring. But, monitoring fast-changing situations and ac- quiring timely, accurate, and cross-national statistics to address short-term mortality fluctuations due to these hazards is very challenging. Estimating weekly excess deaths is the most solid and accurate way to measure the mortality burden caused by short-term risk factors. The Short-term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) data series is one of the significant collections of the Human Mortality Database (HMD) that provides the weekly death counts and rates by age and sex of a country. Sometimes, the data collected from the sources are not always represented in specific age groups rather represented by the the total number of individual death records per week. However, the researchers reclassified their dataset based on the ranges of age and sex distributions of every country so that one can easily find out how many people died in per week of each country based on an equation and earlier distribution data. The paper focuses on the implementation of multi-output regression models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k nearest neighbors, lasso, support vector regressor, artificial neural network, and recurrent neural network to correctly predict death counts for specific age groups. According to the results, random forest delivered the highest performance with an R squared coefficient value of 0.9975, root mean square error of 43.2263, and mean absolute error of 16.4069.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/97f746f6bd849bbd6fa66472f8ebb8bba2a6c09c,97f746f6bd849bbd6fa66472f8ebb8bba2a6c09c,prediction death count based short-term mortality fluctuation data series using multi-output regression model,"Md Imtiaz Ahmed, Nurjahan -, Md.

Usage areas of nanoparticles in veterinary dermatology,"Gökçe İlhan, B. Dokuzeylül, A. Kayar, E. Or","Elements such as gold and silver have been used to treat various diseases since ancient times. These elements, which are used today, have been diversified and sized with many researches. Recently, it is seen that nanoparticles are frequently used in the medical field. Nanoparticles can be 1-1000 nanometers in size and gain biological, physical and chemical functionality due to their nano size. The type and size of these nanoparticles are chosen according to the area in which they will be used. These prepared drugs are used for purposes such as biosensor imaging, transporting drugs to the target organ, protecting the transported substance against denaturations, increasing the immunological response, and transporting chemotherapeutic drugs. 
 
Today, with the increase in the number of dermatological cases in clinics, different treatment methods and systems are being developed. There are various nanoparticles used in dermatological cases to increase the bioavailability of topical, oral or injectable drugs and to increase the effect in the targeted area. These drugs have been used in conditions such as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antifungal, allergen-specific immunotherapy, wound healing, tumors and atopic dermatitis. Many studies have also been carried out in the field of dermatology and it has been shown that nanoparticles used for follicular application provide advantages in dermal drug delivery, including improved skin bioavailability, increased depth of penetration, prolonged residence time, rapid transport to the skin and tissue targeting, in dermal drug delivery by using the appropriate nanoparticles in the right sizes.

"3.M. Round table: Health System Strengthening in the European Union: infrastructure, digitization, health workforce","prison, Zeynep Or, citation, PeterAllebeck, Rachel Moriarty","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has been a severe external shock for health systems across Europe. While immediate responses included building surge capacity and rolling out mass vaccination programmes, the pandemic has highlighted longstanding problems in all health systems. Consequently, policy responses are now focussed on health system strengthening to protect health systems and health workers during future health shocks. For European Union member states, building resilience into health systems has been supported by funding for National Recovery and Resilience Plans that have focussed on investing in infrastructure and digital architecture to future-proof health systems. However, there is also an urgent need to support the health workforce and addressing shortages of health workers will require long-term solutions. This workshop will provide a platform for sharing knowledge on health system strengthening in EU countries. The objectives of the roundtable are to i) identify cross-cutting themes and approaches to health system strengthening in the EU, and ii) establish opportunities for cross-border research and learning. In the workshop we will describe the recent developments in Czechia, Denmark, France and Italy from a comparative perspective. The workshop will consist of a roundtable with four speakers, followed by a broad discussion with audience interventions to bring in the experience of other Member States. The moderated discussion will emphasise learning from other countries in the European Union and the potential for cross-border solutions. Each panel member will make a short presentation on the latest developments in Czechia, Denmark, France, and Italy, drawing on their work writing the latest Health Systems Reviews - highlighting common themes and the role of EU Recovery Funds. Health System Reviews underpin the Health Systems in Transition (HiT) series, a core part of country monitoring undertaken by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies. These Reviews are routinely updated and provide a systematic description of the functioning of health systems in countries as well as reform and policy initiatives in progress or under development. As these are in-depth descriptions which detail the intricacies of health systems and an assessment of their performance, they provide the ideal basis for understanding the true complexity of acute system-wide challenges countries are currently facing. Key messages • Even health systems in high-income countries need strengthening to better cope with future external shocks and building sufficient health workforce capacity is a long-term policy goal. • Drawing on evidence, the workshop will help to identify trends in how health systems are adapting and building resilience in the face of acute system-wide challenges.

Synthetic Microbial Ecology: Engineering Habitats for Modular Consortia,"S. Ben Said, D. Or","The metabolic diversity present in microbial communities enables cooperation toward accomplishing more complex tasks than possible by a single organism. Members of a consortium communicate by exchanging metabolites or signals that allow them to coordinate their activity through division of labor. In contrast with monocultures, evidence suggests that microbial consortia self-organize to form spatial patterns, such as observed in biofilms or in soil aggregates, that enable them to respond to gradient, to improve resource interception and to exchange metabolites more effectively. Current biotechnological applications of microorganisms remain rudimentary, often relying on genetically engineered monocultures (e.g., pharmaceuticals) or mixed-cultures of partially known composition (e.g., wastewater treatment), yet the vast potential of “microbial ecological power” observed in most natural environments, remains largely underused. In line with the Unified Microbiome Initiative (UMI) which aims to “discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems,” we propose in this concept paper to capitalize on ecological insights into the spatial and modular design of interlinked microbial consortia that would overcome limitations of natural systems and attempt to optimize the functionality of the members and the performance of the engineered consortium. The topology of the spatial connections linking the various members and the regulated fluxes of media between those modules, while representing a major engineering challenge, would allow the microbial species to interact. The modularity of such spatially linked microbial consortia (SLMC) could facilitate the design of scalable bioprocesses that can be incorporated as parts of a larger biochemical network. By reducing the need for a compatible growth environment for all species simultaneously, SLMC will dramatically expand the range of possible combinations of microorganisms and their potential applications. We briefly review existing tools to engineer such assemblies and optimize potential benefits resulting from the collective activity of their members.

Multiplanar 3D fluoroscopy redefines tool–lesion relationship during robotic‐assisted bronchoscopy,"O. Kalchiem-Dekel, P. Fuentes, M. Bott, J. Beattie, R. Lee, M. Chawla, B. Husta","Guided bronchoscopy platforms have rapidly evolved over the past two decades to allow high-yield tissue acquisition of suspicious peripheral pulmonary nodules. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy platforms aim to overcome limitations of conventional guided bronchoscopy by allowing for precision access to smaller and more peripheral lesions. The Ion Robotic-Assisted Endoluminal Platform (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) features a console-controlled catheter with an outer diameter of 3.5 mm and a 2.0-mm working channel. Localization within the airway tree is based on a shape-sensing fibre embedded along the catheter’s length and navigation is based on a computed tomography (CT)-generated virtual road map. Following navigation, adjunctive imaging techniques are used to confirm approximation to the lesion. Conventional modalities include radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) and 2D fluoroscopy. Cios-Spin (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) is a mobile 2D–3D C-arm that produces intraoperative 1952 × 1952 pixel images over an area of 295 × 295 mm. Multiplanar 3D imaging is obtained by performing an orbital scan or a spin. Image reconstruction in the axial, coronal and sagittal projections allows intraoperative determination of tool–lesion relationship within lung tissue. Similar to multiplanar fluoroscopy, cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides intraoperative tool–lesion relationship; however, unlike multiplanar fluoroscopy, CBCT platforms are bulky and stationary, require a dedicated operational space and allow less flexibility in utilization across different locations and medical specialties. Moreover, compared with multiplanar fluoroscopy, CBCT entails higher capital costs. Augmented fluoroscopy is achieved by applying machine-learning algorithms supplemented by preoperative CT to 2D fluoroscopy as a navigation tool. Augmented fluoroscopy, however, does not provide detailed CT-like images. Early studies of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy report navigation feasibility of 88–96% and diagnostic yield of 69–79%. A case series of 3D fluoroscopy combined with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy indicated excellent intraoperative visualization of tool–lesion relationship. The combination of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with intraoperative confirmation of tool–lesion relationship by multiplanar 3D fluoroscopy for the sampling of peripheral lung lesions has yet to be reported in humans. This study’s objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a novel combination of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy guided by intraoperative, multiplanar 3D fluoroscopy in the sampling of peripheral pulmonary lesions. We performed a retrospective, single-centre review of all patients who underwent 3D fluoroscopy-guided robotic-assisted bronchoscopy for the sampling of peripheral lung lesions in our institution between 1 March and 30 March 2020. The study protocol was approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering institutional review board (#20-102). An informed consent waiver was provided on the basis of a retrospective patient record review. All study participants’ privacy was protected, and data confidentiality was maintained. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy was performed with the Ion platform under general anaesthesia. Following navigation to the target, RP-EBUS (UM-S20-17S or UMS20-20R-3; Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) was advanced and sonographic target visualization was classified as concentric, eccentric or no view. Once position was confirmed, a 19-, 21or 23-G Flexision cytology needle (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Needle size was determined by the operator at the time of the procedure. A breath-hold was then initiated, and intraoperative 3D fluoroscopy spin was performed with the Cios-Spin mobile 3D C-arm, utilizing the standard imaging protocol and the soft tissue algorithm. If deemed necessary, the robotic catheter was redirected to optimize tool– lesion relationship and repeat RP-EBUS and/or 3D fluoroscopy were employed for further confirmation. A maximum of three 3D fluoroscopy spins were allowed per patient to limit radiation exposure. Once a satisfactory position was achieved, the lesion was sampled by needle. Forceps biopsies were obtained at the discretion of the operator. All 3D fluoroscopy images were retrospectively reviewed, and needle–lesion relationship was determined by a consensus between four expert interventional pulmonologists. Tool–lesion relationship was classified as centre hit (tool in the centre of the lesion), off-centre hit (tool in the periphery of the lesion or traversing it with the tip distal to the lesion) or miss (tool outside the lesion). Study data were managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. Over the study period, 10 lesions were sampled in five female and three male patients. The median age was 64 years (range: 36–83). Data related to lesion, procedure and sampling results are summarized in Table 1. The median lesion size was 1.45 cm (range: 0.73–7.74) and 9 of 10 lesions were radiographically solid. Navigation to target was successful in all cases. The RP-EBUS view was concentric in six and eccentric in four lesions. A median of 1.5 3D fluoroscopy spins (range: 1–3) were performed per patient.

Applications of Energy Psychology in Addressing the Psychological Roots of Illness,"D. Feinstein, Ashland Or East Main Street","The impact of psychological factors on illness is, in recent years, being biochemically mapped. The subspecialties of psychosomatic medicine, health psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, and integrative medicine work with mind and body in concert to promote health and healing. A specialized set of mind-body approaches, collectively called “energy psychology,” is being utilized within these and related clinical frameworks to facilitate beneficial changes in the neurological underpinnings of (1) mental states that impede immune function, (2) emotional influences that contribute to illness, and (3) inner resources that promote healing. Combining practices from time-honored healing traditions, particularly acupressure, with concepts and techniques drawn from contemporary psychology, practitioners using one of the most popular variations of the approach teach patients to tap on a prescribed series of acupuncture points while repeating phrases that activate areas of the brain that are involved with the issue receiving attention. Preliminary evidence supports speculation, which is consistent with more than a hundred peer-reviewed clinical trials, that the procedure can send deactivating signals to areas of the limbic system that are in hyperarousal and can send activating signals to regions of the prefrontal cortex that support executive functions such as planning and managing stressful situations. Ways of utilizing the approach for addressing emotional and cognitive aspects of physical illness are discussed. While utilizing the best medical OBM Integrative and Complementary Medicine 2021; 6(2), doi:10.21926/obm.icm.2102014 Page 2/24 interventions available remains the first line of treatment, the potential value of working with the psychological aspects of disease is frequently underestimated.

ISOZYME VARIATION IN THE RACES OF MAIZE FROM MEXICO,"J. Doebley, Or M Goodman, Charles W. Stuber","Twelve plants each of 94 collections of maize (Zea mays L. subsp. mays) representing 34 races from Mexico were analyzed for 13 enzyme systems encoded by 23 loci. This analysis revealed an exceptionally high level of variation within and among the races. We recorded an average of 7.09 alleles/locus and an expected heterozygosity of 0.182. Seventy-two percent of the isozyme variation resided within collections, and 27% among collections. Races from northern and northwestern Mexico tend to possess higher levels of variation than those from the south. Variation for some isozyme alleles is strongly correlated with altitude. Maize is among the most variable species that have been studied isoenzymatically. Maize has levels of variation comparable to those found in its wild relatives, the teosintes. Principal component and cluster analyses showed continuous variation among the races with no well-defined racial complexes; however, three weakly differentiated groups were apparent: 1) the high-elevation Mexican pyramidal races, 2) the northern and northwestern races, and 3) most remaining races including the southern and western low-elevation dent and flour corns. of Mexico from the desert northwest to the tropical lowlands of Chiapas. Over this ecogeographic landscape, maize has diversified into a multitude of forms, each adapted to the demands of its environment and the desires of its cultivators. Because the morphological-ecological variation among these forms is continuous in nature, the classification of Mexican maize into discrete categories is difficult. Despite these difficulties, Wellhausen, Roberts and Hernandez (1952) produced a useful morphological classification of Mexican maize including the description of 29 races and subraces. This work and the more recent description of five additional Mexican maize races by Hernandez and Alanis (1970) provide an understanding of the racial diversity in Mexican maize. In this paper, we examine the pattern of isozyme variation among and within the races of maize of Mexico. The isozyme data are used to examine relationships among the races and to assess the amount of genetic variation within each race. Further, the correlations between isozyme variation and ecological-geographical parameters are discussed and the amount of genetic variation in Mexican maize, teosinte, and other plants compared. MATERIA1S AND METHODSWe examined 12 plants each from 93 collections of maize from Mexico and 1 collection from Guatemala (TaMAIZE (Zea mays L. subsp. mays) is the third most important cereal worldwide and the single most important food plant in Latin America. In Mexico and other Latin American countnes, maize has a central role in the native cultures, being displayed with prominence and reverence in both religious ceremonies and secular festivals (Anderson, 1952; Mangelsdorf 1974). The cultural importance of maize in Mexican society testifies to its long history of cultivation in this country. The oldest known archaeological maize ears were discovered near Puebla, Mexico, and were dated to the fifth millenium B.C. (MacNeish, 1967). This and other evidence have established Mexico as the cradle of maize domestication (Mangelsdorf, 1974). Not surprisingly, Mexico is also the homeland of the only close relative and probable wild ancestor of maize, teosinte (Wilkes, 1967; Doebley, 1983).

Assimes, MD, PhD Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17 million deaths annually, a rate which outpaces even that related to cancer. Despite these sobering statistics, the stateof-the-art in computational infrastructure for the study of contemporary datasets related to CVD lags substantially behind that widely available in oncology, where improved data science and visualization methods have delivered publicly available comprehensive cancer genomics resources like Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s cBioPortal1,2 and the National Cancer Institute’s Genomic Data Commons Portal.3,4 In our view, such portals do an outstanding job of transforming data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into logical data visualizations that provide additional biological insight. Developing a similar user-friendly computational platform for CVD could significantly lower the barriers of discovery by providing researchers with rapid, intuitive, and high-quality visual access to molecular profiles and clinical attributes from existing CVD projects. To our knowledge, no open-access computational resource for interactive visual exploration of multidimensional -omics datasets focused on CVD exists that rivals the utility, simplicity, and power of cBioPortal or the Genomic Data Commons Portal. Although a large amount of data from various CVD studies has been deposited in dbGaP, these data are only accessible to researchers after a time-consuming manual review of databases to identify relevant datasets and a somewhat onerous administrative data request process. Within the field of CVD research, the American Heart Association’s Precision Medicine Platform has significantly facilitated access to such data by streamlining the search, request, and transfer of controlled-access data and harmonizing datasets for cloud-based analyses.5 Notwithstanding these important contributions of the Precision Medicine Platform, we note that the Platform’s output currently mimics the content of TCGA (ie, raw and harmonized data with no preprocessing or visualization of its internals). Although the strength of the Precision Medicine Platform centers on providing curated CVD datasets, programming tools/tutorials, and forums for collaboration, a need that remains unmet is an informatics infrastructure that can quickly distill CVD-related datasets into easy-to-interpret, insightful figures and charts in a manner analogous to the cBioPortal and Genomic Data Commons Portal, but whose content is updated on a regular basis. Here we present HeartBioPortal (https://www.heartbioportal.com), a publicly available web application that takes the first important steps towards fulfilling this need by integrating existing CVD-related omics datasets in real time across the biological dataverse to provide intuitive visualization and analyses in addition to data downloads.

Design and Implementation of a HCI Course for MIS Students-Some Lessons,R. Or-Bach,"Introduction Courses on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in Computer Science, in Information Systems and in other Information Technology departments largely differ in topics to be included, emphases, instructional strategies that are employed, and more. The differences do not necessarily depend on the type of the department (e.g., Computer Science versus Management Information Systems) but on the way the instructor (or the faculty) perceives the role of such a course in the curriculum as well as the role of HCI in a system development cycle. The perception of the role of the HCI course directs the emphases to be addressed in the course. The instructional strategies that are employed in such a course are usually derived from the above as well as from the instructor's learning and teaching philosophy. It is widely recognized that the user interface is of major importance in any software project. The estimation is that at least 50% of work on a software project goes into the design and implementation of the user interface (Daniel et al., 2007; Kennard & Leaney, 2010). In today's world of fast development and deployment of technology, HCI factors are even more critical and fundamental and, thus, should be well addressed in the curriculum (Douglas, Tremaine, Leventhal, Wills, & Manaris, 2002; Peslak, 2005). Carey et al. (2004) stress the role of human-computer interaction in Management Information Systems (MIS) curricula and differentiate between CHI (Computer Human Interaction) and HCI to indicate the different points of view (computer versus human). The importance of HCI in MIS education will be further discussed in the next section. Homework assignments that are given during a course, whether for formative or summative assessment, provide indicators for students about the relative importance of the different topics or concepts involved in the course. Shepard (2000), in a paper titled ""The Role of Assessment in a Learning Culture"", stresses the need to design assessments that match the subject matter standards and serve to instantiate what it means to know and learn in each discipline. Besides the content, the instructional method that is employed to support learning in a course might also provide a model for preferred processes regarding the implementation of the learned materials. The learning process that an instructional method models and promotes can provide a foundation on which a lifetime of learning in work and other social settings can be built (Boud & Falchikov, 2006). The design of the assessment assignments in the course that is described in this paper followed these ideas. The assignments were planned to focus on the main concepts and procedures for designing an interface along with team work that characterizes the respective work culture. The formative evaluation study described in this paper examines how the emphases of the course that are reflected in the course assignments (content and respective pedagogy) relate to the students' final submitted project. The final project included an interface prototype, description of design considerations, and description of the interface evaluation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews curricular approaches and instructional strategies for a HCI course instruction. The third section describes the main characteristics of our HCI course, including a detailed description of each of the course assignments. The fourth section, with its subsections, describes the goals of the study, the tools, and the findings of the study. The fifth section summarizes the findings and discusses the key results.

Limited Impact of Smoking Bans on Commercial Outdoor Dining Area in a Smoking Hot Spot: A Case Study,"F. Stephanie, Birkett John, O. Sharon, Daly Angela, C. Peter","Objectives: An evaluation of the implementation of smokefree commercial outdoor dining was carried out to evaluate proprietors’ awareness and preparedness for the implementation of Smoke-Free Outdoor Dining regulations in Liverpool, Australia. Methods: A pre-post assessment of the awareness and preparedness for smoke-free Commercial Outdoor Dining (COD) bans commencing in NSW on the 6 July 2015 was carried out at 19 COD premises in Liverpool’s Macquarie Mall by the Public Health Unit. Results: The study found limited effectiveness of the smoking bans in the area, despite a high level of awareness of key changes required and high level of preparedness for the smoke-free COD regulations. The majority of COD operators chose to provide a designated smoking area to allow patrons to continue to smoke legally. Over two thirds (69%) of operators were concerned/somewhat concerned about the impact of the bans on their business before the bans but decreased to 55% (10) after the bans. Conclusions: Once proprietors understood that they had options, a majority of COD operators chose to change their business operations in order to allow customers to lawfully continue to smoke. Implications for public health: Loopholes in COD regulations have resulted in consumers being increasingly exposed to smoke. A multi-sectoral approach is needed to review the legislation and protect consumers.

Smart Apartment with Demand-Response And Fixed Batteries,"Hayato Tahara, Hidehito Matayoshi, Harun Or Rashid Or Rashid Howlader, Sharma Aditya, T. Senjyu","In Japan, each apartment’s dweller generally make contract with the electric power company to receive low voltage electric power. However, in recent years, trader of bulk high voltages (aggregators) have been increasing. In this study, the introduction of demandresponse along with the utilization of a fixed battery in the apartment is proposed in order to decrease the peak load and reduce the peak load cost of receiving high voltage. In this way, the trader of bulk high voltage can increase the profits whereas, apartment dwellers can decrease their electricity bills by demand-response. Accordingly, this study applies a multi-objective optimization method. The profit of the trader is maximized while the electricity charge for the apartment dwellers is decreased by Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms-II (NSGAII) which is utilized multiobjective optimization algorithm. INTRODUCTION The trader of bulk high voltages (aggregators) deal with electric power company in high voltage and then sell the power to apartment’s dwellers. Receiving high voltage power has an advantage of low price per kWh. Thus, the difference between electricity charges from apartment and for electric power company become the profit for the trader of bulk high voltage. In this research, the trader of bulk high voltage applies the real-time pricing as a demand-response to level the load demand of apartment (Angarita and Usaola, 2007; Nguyen and Yoon, 2014; Zakariazadeh et al., 2014). Furthermore, the trader utilizes a fixed battery, electric vehicle (EV), and heat pump (HP) to perform peak-cut of load. On the other hand, the each apartment dwellers can reduce the electric charges significantly by adjusting one’s power consumption for realtime price. However, there is a trade-off relationship between increasing profit for the trader and decreasing electricity charge for the apartment dwellers. In this paper, from the above relationship, NSGAII that is multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied (Deb, 2001; Ippolito et al., 2014). The real-time price and operation schedules of a fixed battery, EV, HP for a full day are optimized for considering the benefit between the trader and apartment dwellers. The demand-response characteristics of dwellers are simulated by sigmoid function (Tahara et al., 2015). MATLAB which is numerical computation tool is used for simulation. SMART APARTMENT MODEL Figure 1 illustrates the smart apartment model which includes 100 households (Yoza et al., 2011) . The photovoltaic system (PV) and a fixed battery have been introduced into the apartment model. The rated power of the photovoltaic system is 20 kW. The capacity of a fixed battery and rated inverter output are 2,000 kWh and 20 kW respectively. In addition, 10 HPs with a rated power consumption of 10 kW have been introduced into the apartment. It can be defined that a COP value of the heat pumps is 3.5. The proposed contract form among the smart apartments, a electric power company and the trader of bulk high voltage is shown in Figure 2. The trader of bulk high voltage deals with the electric power company for getting high voltage power, then sales the low voltage power to aprtment’s dwellers. The receiving power contract in high voltage has an advantage of low price. Thus, the difference between electricity charges from dewlers and for electric power company become the profit of the trader of bulk high voltage. Moreover, in order to perform load power leveling, the bulk high voltage trader apply realtime pricing as a demand-response method and utilize the fixed battery, EVs and HP. Therefore, the trader of bulk high voltage can reduce the peak load cost by raceiving high voltage from electric power company. On the other hand, the each dweller can reduce the electricity charges significantly by adjusting one’s power consumption for real-time price. The hot water supply system from HP using solar In this paper, the HP has three solar collection panels (SC) as a auxiliary heat source (Yoza et al., 2014). The space of a SC ASC , the efficiency of SC ηSC are 1.6 m, 60 % correspndingly. The hot water supply system using SC can be modified by equations (1)∼(7) (Yoza et al., 2013; Yoza and Funabashi, 2013). The characteristics of hot water temperature depends on the ambient temperature, the solar insolation and time.

An Analysis of International Construction Risk Factors on Partner Selection by Applying ANP Approach,"Guzin Aydogan, Almula Koksal, M. Sinan","International construction involves uncertainties similar to domestic construction projects as well as risks specific to the host country. International contractors usually establish partnerships with a local firm in order to reduce risks and obtain knowledge of current local business practices and general knowledge of the local economy, politics and customs since they are unfamiliar with these institutional environments. Selecting an appropriate partner and considering the political, economic and socio-economic environment of a foreign country is essential for the formation and operation of a successful venture. Industry related factors and project related factors are the common risk factors that affect both domestic and international construction projects. In this respect, host country related factors, industry related factors and project related factors are considered as the main parameters of the partner selection process for international construction joint ventures (ICJVs), and the criteria of these factors are determined thorough literature review. The aim of this study is to assess the priorities of the determined risk factors in partner selection for ICJVs. Analytical network process (ANP) is selected as the most appropriate tool for this study as it allows interdependencies between components of a problem. A two phases of survey was conducted. Within the context of this study, the priorities and the weights of the determined risk factors are revealed. As a result; political stability, socio-economic stability, force majeure, inflation, government policy to construction sector and the strength of the legal system are found to be most important determinants of the partner selection process. The paper is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers.

"Obituary: Ajit Dhaunchak, Ph.D","Omar de Faria, A. Bar-Or, A. Awasthi","On the 18th of August 2012, Ajit Singh Dhaunchak passed away at the age of 33 in Quebec, Canada. His tragic and premature death was a terrible loss to his family, friends and colleagues, all of whom miss his dynamic personality and ever-smiling presence. At his funereal, Phil Barker, interim director of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) at the time, emphasized how Ajit embodied that rare strain of scientist who combines gifted intellect, hard working, and seemingly endless stamina, with a most personable and charismatic personality— a remarkable set of qualities with which Ajit engaged and inspired all around him. Here, we wish to remember aspects of Ajit’s professional life that reinforce Dr. Barker’s observation and pay homage to a dear colleague and friend who, in all too short a life, already made important contributions to the field of neuroscience. Ajit was born on August 1, 1979 in the city of Chandigarh, India, where he grew up and later entered the Panjab University to study Biophysics. Even as an undergraduate student he took a keen interest in understanding complex biological processes. When others were struggling to make sense of the course material, he could be seen reading books on protein chemistry and other topics well beyond the scope of the assigned course work. Apart from being an inspired student Ajit was also a gifted sportsman. Whether as an undergraduate student in India, a Ph.D student in Germany, or a postdoc in Canada—he always found time and friends to play his two favorite games— Cricket and Chess. After graduating from Panjab University, Ajit left India, and moved to Germany where he enrolled in an integrated M.Sc-Ph.D program at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine. As a Ph.D student in the lab of Prof. Klaus-Armin Nave, he was introduced to the field of myelin biology and white matter diseases. His Ph.D research focused on the major myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP), and its mutations in association to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). A paper published in Journal of Cell Biology, which summarizes part of the results obtained during his Ph.D, demonstrates that neuron-glia interactions regulate cell-surface expression of PLP in oligodendrocytes (Trajkovic et al., 2006). A second paper, published in PNAS, demonstrates that PMD-related mutations localized to the extracellular loop of PLP lead to protein cross-linking and PLP retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Dhaunchak and Nave, 2007). Ajit was one of the very few students who managed to defend their Ph.D thesis in less than 3 years. In 2007, soon after completing his Ph.D, Ajit joined the MNI and McGill University in Quebec, Canada, as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of the late Dr. David R. Colman. There, Ajit continued to study PLP while also expanding his research interests and establishing several productive collaborations to investigate complementary aspects of white matter biology. He became particularly interested in the application of systems-biology approaches to the study of myelin and myelin diseases. In this context, Ajit made important contributions to our knowledge of the myelin proteome, lipidome, and transcriptome, both in health and disease. In work published in Glia, Ajit and colleagues provide a catalogue of novel proteins identified in axoglial specializations isolated from the human Central Nervous System (Dhaunchak et al., 2010). In another proteomic study lead by Ajit and featured in Annals of Neurology, a collaborative study by the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Network provided evidence indicating that the myelin axoglial apparatus is disrupted at early stages of childhoodonset Multiple Sclerosis (Dhaunchak et al., 2012). In all, Ajit published eight papers during his post-doc in leading neuroscience journals and initiated or became involved in several other projects that continue even after his death. During his last few months at the MNI, Ajit was busy writing project proposals and preparing for job interviews. Anyone listening to him practice a job talk had the distinct impression that in fact Ajit had already been running an active lab for several years, reflecting the large amount of quality data he had generated as well as his deep overall grasp of the field. There was no doubt Ajit was to become a most successful independent researcher, and everyone from fellow trainees to principle investigators at the MNI were certain that it’s just a matter of time before he would get the position he wanted.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b62ac3c473cbdd1ce8959b32649bf29904496e37,b62ac3c473cbdd1ce8959b32649bf29904496e37,obituary ajit dhaunchak ph.d,"Omar de Faria, A.

CORRELATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF INTROGRESSIVE POPULATIONS,Or M Goodman,"Anderson (1949) has reviewed in detail the currently available techniques for the study of introgression. He has indicated (Anderson 1954, 1956, 1957) that the use of metroglyphs (the ""pictures"" used in pictorial scatter diagrams) is the most efficient means of analyzing suspected examples of introgression. Earlier Anderson (1939) presented a genetic rationale upon which such graphical techniques may be based. To summarize Anderson's reasoning briefly (Anderson, 1939, 1949, 1953), the use of metroglyphs for introgression analysis is based upon the assumption that the presumably quantitatively inherited genes affecting taxonomic characters are linked sufficiently strongly to cause graphically detectable correlations among these characters in the offspring of species hybrids. Actually, correlations among taxonomic characters can result from several different mechanisms. The evidence that linkage is the usual cause is very limited. [ Grant (1950, 1954, 1956), Clausen and Hiesey (1958), Hiesey et al. (1963), and Nobs et al. (1964) all present similar types of data which suggest, but do not prove, that substantial taxonomic correlations can be caused by linkage.] There is both experimental evidence (Collins and Kempton, 1920; Kearney, 1923, 1926; Klekowski, 1964) and theoretical evidence (Dempster, 1949) that linkage does not account for the establishment of such correlations. Furthermore, there are theoretical reasons why linkage cannot account for the maintenance of such correlations if they should be established by some other means (Lush, 1948). At least two factors other than linkage can cause correlations among taxonomic traits. First, natural selection may effectively eliminate recombinant types, with an apparent strengthening of any linkage present. Second, if the habitat of a well-established species is subject to a limited amount of immigration from a second species with which the first species is cross-fertile, the resulting population will be in a state of disequilibrium. In such a case, plants with genotypes intermediate between or similar to those typical of the two parental species are more frequent than those with genotypes combining different features of the two parental species (recombinant types). Although Anderson has assumed that the graphical methods devised for the study of introgression are based upon correlations caused by a lack of free recombination among loci affecting taxonomic traits, the same methods should also be valid in the two cases discussed above. The purpose of this study was to reinvestigate the degree of multiple correlation (presumably caused by linkage) among taxonomic characters in the segregating generations which follow interspecific hybridization and to compare this with the degree of multiple correlation caused by continuous crossing.

Cross-Species Hybridizations to Spotted Microarrays as a Tool for Functional Genomics of Horticultural Plants,"Carmiya Bar-Or, Ayelet Bar-akiva, Y. Kapulnik, H. Czosnek, M. Oren-Shamir, H. Koltai","Genomic-scale gene profiling using DNA microarrays has become a powerful approach for the study of gene expression in diversity of species. Nevertheless, for many species of interest, including many horticulturally important plants, ready made microarrays are still not available. Therefore, for functional genomics studies of such plants, a possible tool for gene expression profiling is the use of a microarray of a phylogenetically related organism for cross-species hybridizations (CSHs). We examined the ability of cross-species hybridization to reflect a biological process. As a benchmark experiment we generated two datasets: one of potato RNA hybridized to tomato microarray (CSH), the other of potato RNA hybridized to potato microarray (species-specific hybridization; SSH). Results were compared on a transcriptomic scale. The results demonstrated difficulties for the transcriptomic data obtained from CSH to reproduce the results obtained from SSH. Nevertheless, once the data were filtered for the matched probe sets, the CSH data showed higher consistency with that of the SSH and facilitated identification of significantly regulated genes, some of which were mutual to both CSH and SSH data. The considerations outlined as a result are serving for CSH of Brunfelsia flowers (a Solanaceae) with the potato microarray, resulting in further refinement of the approach of CSH for profiling horticulturally relevant, biological processes. INTRODUCTION DNA microarrays enable researchers to conduct large-scale quantitative experiments on gene expression. These experiments profile gene expression during biological processes, elucidating molecular mechanisms, assigning functions to previously unannotated genes and grouping of genes into functional pathways (reviewed in Stoughton, 2005). However, many species are lacking a representative microarray platform. Therefore, in the last few years, the use of cross-species hybridization (CSH, i.e., the hybridization of RNA from a target species to a microarray from a reference species) has greatly expanded as a tool for transcriptome analysis in species that lack a microarray platform (e.g., Chitko-McKown et al., 2004; Brodsky et al., 2005; Chalmers et al., 2005; Grigoryev et al., 2005) and as a tool for comparative, evolution and ecology studies (e.g., Ranz et al., 2003; Rifkin et al., 2003; Held et al., 2004; Rise et al., 2004; Gilad et al., 2006). Nevertheless, CSH should be considered a non-standard application of microarrays, since microarrays are designed and built for species-specific hybridizations (SSHs) rather than for CSHs. Hence, when CSH is required for a given study, the validity and quality of the resulting biological data should be examined. The use of CSH assumes the ability to analyze the gene expression profiles, so that biologically meaningful knowledge may be obtained. In our present study, we examined the ability of CSH to reflect biological results, by hybridizing RNA samples from the same species, for both cross-species (heterologous) and species-specific (homologous) microarray hybridizations. Thus, a direct comparison between results generated by CSH Proc. XXVII IHC-S7 Struct. and Funct. Genomics of Hort. Plants Ed.-in-Chief: R. Drew Acta Hort. 763, ISHS 2007 26 and SSH was feasible. As a result, determination of the quality of CSH compared to SSH was obtained and approaches were developed for improving the validity of the CSH results published by our group (Bar-Or et al., 2006). These were modified for CSH of Brunfelsia flowers (a Solanaceae) with potato microarray, to unveil components involved in the process of pigment degradation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tomato and Potato Microarray Description A tomato and a potato cDNA microarray were used. The tomato cDNA microarray was developed and printed by the Center of Gene Expression Profiling (CGEP; Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); it contains 9,140 sequenced clones, selected at random from a number of different cDNA libraries derived from a range of tissues including leaf, root, fruit and flower (Center for Gene Expression Profiling [http://bti.cornell.edu/CGEP/ CGEP.html]). The potato cDNA microarray version 3 was developed and printed by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, Rockville, MD); it contains 15,264 cDNA clones, selected from the potato stolon, root, microtuber, dormant tuber, germinating eye, healthy leaf and Phytophthora infestans-challenged libraries (NSF Potato Functional Genomics [http://www.tigr.org/tdb/potato/microarray_comp.shtml]). RNA Source 1. Nematode-Infected and Non-Infected (Control) Potato. For each of the two timepoints of nematode infection examined (5 and 10 d), two paired observations were applied. All paired observations were taken at the same greenhouse, but at different times. Each paired observation consisted of 2 groups of 6 plants, grown on adjacent plates. A detailed description of plant growth, inoculation and dissection is described in Bar Or et al. (2006). 2. Brunfelsia Flowers during Pigment Degradation. RNA was extracted from flowers detached from the plant at day 0 (the flower opening day) and day 1 (following flower opening). Three paired observations were applied; each consisted of 2 groups of 4– 6 flowers each, grown in adjacent pots. RNA Samples Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA samples were subjected to amplification with the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), using 2.5 to 5 μg of total RNA as starting material. RNA Labeling, Microarray Hybridizations and Data Acquisition Heterologous hybridizations of potato RNA to the tomato microarray were designated as PT and those of the potato RNA to the potato microarray were designated as PP. Details regarding the PT and PP hybridizations are reported by Bar-Or et al. (2006). Heterologous hybridizations of Brunfelsia RNA to potato microarray were performed such that each sample (from 0 or 1 day, designated BP0 and BP1, respectively) was labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. The day 0 and day 1 samples were co-hybridized, and dye swap experiments were performed. Data Normalization and Analysis The output files of the PT and PP and BP experiments were normalized according to GeneSpring (GeneSpring 5.1; Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), including by Lowess normalization (Smyth and Speed, 2003; Bar-Or et al., 2006). For the PT and PP data analysis was performed as described by Bar-Or et al. (2006). For the BP experiments data analysis included determination of the ratio of day 1 to day 0 of each of the hybridizations, for each biological replicate, for each technical replicate (resulting in analysis of 6 samples). The results were clustered using GeneSpring.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c02a5c225f5a4ccdcfdd36dd6eb65c831cf5afe,2c02a5c225f5a4ccdcfdd36dd6eb65c831cf5afe,cross-species hybridization spotted microarrays tool functional genomics horticultural plant,"Carmiya Bar, Ayelet Bar, Y.

Trisenox (Arsenic Trioxide) in the Treatment for Multiple Myeloma after Bone Marrow Transplantation.,"B. Gesundheit, M. Shapira, I. Resnick, M. Bitan, D. Ben-yehuda, S. Slavin, R. Or","Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease, with median survival of 4–6 years despite various new therapeutic approaches including autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). New agents are studied and Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) seems to be a promising additional agent against progressive and refractory MM. Various mechanisms are described for the therapeutic effect of ATO: growth inhibition of myeloma cells; induction of apoptosis of drug resistant MM cell lines; inhibition of angiogenesis by blocking VEGF; interaction with BM microenvironment; immunologic mechanisms by a marked increase in lymphokine-activated Killer (LAK)-mediated killing and up-modulation of CD38 and CD54; inhibition of myeloma cells to stick to BM stromal cells by inhibiting IL-6. ATO is a form of arsenic, a naturally occurring element (As2O3), which was used for various therapeutic purposes for more than 2000 years. ATO was first approved by the FDA in 2000 for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and is investigated for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and other indications for ATO are currently under investigation. We report our preliminary data from our clinical experience with ATO for 4 patients with MM after BMT, who had evidence of active and progressive disease. Other therapeutic approaches failed or were not relevant. ATO was given at low doses of 0.15 mg/kg/dose twice weekly and after respond at 0.3 mg/kg/dose once weekly. ATO was given intravenously in slow infusion over 2 hours together with intravenous lipids 500 ml (20%) to reduce ATO toxicity. ECG, markers for myeloma and possible adverse effects were monitored carefully. Oral ascorbic acid 500 mg twice daily was added to improve the effect of ATO. Our patients showed evidence of response to ATO both at the level of residual tumor mass and M-protein secretion. Furthermore, in one patient with severe GvHD we observed significant improvement of the GvHD manifestations concomittantly with Graft versus Myeloma effect. Based on our data and the review of the literature regarding the use of ATO for MM, ATO might play in the future an established role in the treatment for MM. ATO might induce and augment immunomodulatory effects of Graft versus Myeloma. We discuss future research for the use of ATO in the treatment of MM.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d3c4f3b5c687b508e2522cc31d0d23e0afbb7c6,7d3c4f3b5c687b508e2522cc31d0d23e0afbb7c6,trisenox arsenic trioxide treatment multiple myeloma bone marrow transplantation,"B.

Physical processes affecting microbial habitats and activity in unsaturated agricultural soils,"D. Or, S. Friedman, J. Norton","experimental methods for quantifying effects of water content and other dynamic environmental factors on bacterial growth in partially-saturated soils. Towards this end we reviewed critically the relevant scientific literature and performed theoretical and experimental studies of bacterial growth and activity in modeled, idealized and real unsaturated soils. The natural wetting-drying cycles common to agricultural soils affect water content and liquid organization resulting in fragmentation of aquatic habitats and limit hydraulic connections. Consequently, substrate diffusion pathways to soil microbial communities become limiting and reduce nutrient fluxes, microbial growth, and mobility. Key elements that govern the extent and manifestation of such ubiquitous interactions include characteristics of diffusion pathways and pore space, the timing, duration, and extent of environmental perturbations, the nature of microbiological adjustments (short-term and longterm), and spatial distribution and properties of EPS clusters (microcolonies). Of these key elements we have chosen to focus on a manageable subset namely on modeling microbial growth and coexistence on simple rough surfaces, and experiments on bacterial growth in variably saturated sand samples and columns. Our extensive review paper providing a definitive “snap-shot” of present scientific understanding of microbial behavior in unsaturated soils revealed a lack of modeling tools that are essential for enhanced predictability of microbial processes in soils. We therefore embarked on two pronged approach of development of simple microbial growth models based on diffusion-reaction principles to incorporate key controls for microbial activity in soils such as diffusion coefficients and temporal variations in soil water content (and related substrate diffusion rates), and development of new methodologies in support of experiments on microbial growth in simple and observable porous media under controlled water status conditions. Experimental efforts led to a series of microbial growth experiments in granular media under variable saturation and ambient conditions, and introduction of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to study cell size, morphology and multi-cell arrangement at a high resolution from growth experiments in various porous media. The modeling efforts elucidated important links between unsaturated conditions and microbial coexistence which is believed to support the unparallel diversity found in soils. We examined the role of spatial and temporal variation in hydration conditions (such as exist in agricultural soils) on local growth rates and on interactions between two competing microbial species. Interestingly, the complexity of soil spaces and aquatic niches are necessary for supporting a rich microbial diversity and the wide array of microbial functions in unsaturated soils. This project supported collaboration between soil physicists and soil microbiologist that is absolutely essential for making progress in both disciplines. It provided a few basic tools (models, parameterization) for guiding future experiments and for gathering key information necessary for prediction of biological processes in agricultural soils. The project sparked a series of ongoing studies (at DTU and EPFL and in the ARO) into effects of soil hydration dynamics on microbial survival strategy under short term and prolonged desiccation (important for general scientific and agricultural applications).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67d663fd4443e3167dbfef3d4fd637b91267aa90,67d663fd4443e3167dbfef3d4fd637b91267aa90,physical process affecting microbial habitat activity unsaturated agricultural soil,"D.
