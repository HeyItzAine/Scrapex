Inspection and monitoring systems subsea pipelines: A review paper,"Michael Ho, S. El-Borgi, Devendra Patil, G. Song","One of the largest movers of the world economy is the oil and gas industry. The industry generates billions of barrels of oil to match more than half the world’s energy demands. Production of energy products at such a massive scale is supported by the equally massive oil and gas infrastructure sprawling around the globe. Especially characteristic of the industry are vast networks of pipelines that traverse tens of thousands of miles of land and sea to carry oil and gas from the deepest parts of the earth to faraway destinations. With such lengths come increased chances for damage, which can have disastrous consequences owing to the hazardous substances typically carried by pipelines. Subsea pipelines in particular face increased risk due to the typically harsher environments, the difficulty of accessing deepwater pipelines, and the possibility of sea currents spreading leaked oil across a wide area. The opportunity for research and engineering to overcome the challenge of subsea inspection and monitoring is tremendous and the progress in this area is continuously generating exciting new developments that may have far reaching benefits far outside of subsea pipeline inspection and monitoring. Thus, this review covers the most often used subsea inspection and monitoring technologies as well as their most recent developments and future trends.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13e43f850d642e95d44dc2fc04d017f286ac04f3,13e43f850d642e95d44dc2fc04d017f286ac04f3

Environmental risk factors for cancer - review paper.,"A. Lewandowska, M. Rudzki, S. Rudzki, T. Lewandowski, B. Laskowska","The cancerous process is result of disturbed cell function. This is due to the accumulation of many genetic and epigenetic changes within the cell, expressed in the accumulation of chromosomal or molecular aberrations, which leads to genetic instability. It is difficult to assess the validity of individual aetiological factors, but it can be concluded that interaction of various risk factors has the largest contribution to the cancer development. Environmental, exogenous and endogenous factors as well as individual factors, including genetic predisposition contribute to the development of cancer. Epidemiological research on the development of malignant tumors has focused over the years on the determinants of environmental and genetic factors of cancer incidence and mortality rate. According to current state of knowledge, 80-90% of malignant tumors are caused by external environmental factors (carcinogens). Epidemiological studies have proved that the main factors responsible for the development of malignant neoplasia among humans are environmental factors arising from human behaviour. It has been confirmed that smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, diet, and reproductive behaviour are important for the development of malignant neoplasia in the human population. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020 we may expect about 10 million deaths, including 7-8 million in the developing countries, while this number in the developed countries will not change and will be 2-3 million. The aim this study was systematization of knowledge concerning the risk factors of malignant tumours and supplementing them with the latest research results.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/13245ea3f5488f73e93cc3b26454c17b1a5ad928,13245ea3f5488f73e93cc3b26454c17b1a5ad928

"Review: the resource-based view and information systems research: review, extension, and suggestions for future research","M. Wade, J. Hulland","Information systems researchers have a long tradition of drawing on theories from disciplines such as economics, computer science, psychology, and general management and using them in their own research. Because of this, the information systems field has become a rich tapestry of theoretical and conceptual foundations. As new theories are brought into the field, particularly theories that have become dominant in other areas, there may be a benefit in pausing to assess their use and contribution in an IS context. The purpose of this paper is to explore and critically evaluate use of the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) by IS researchers. 
 
The paper provides a brief review of resource-based theory and then suggests extensions to make the RBV more useful for empirical IS research. First, a typology of key IS resources is presented, and these are then described using six traditional resource attributes. Second, we emphasize the particular importance of looking at both resource complementarity and moderating factors when studying IS resource effects on firm performance. Finally, we discuss three considerations that IS researchers need to address when using the RBV empirically. Eight sets of propositions are advanced to help guide future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/997f0644155b4c3d0be4164250a8bd6ad4b9a161,997f0644155b4c3d0be4164250a8bd6ad4b9a161
A Sustainable Tourism Policy Research Review,"Yiru Guo, Jinbo Jiang, Shengchao Li","After nearly three decades of development, sustainable tourism has been widely recognized in tourism policy practice and tourism research. In recent years, scholars have paid more and more attention to the topic of sustainable tourism policy research. The purpose of this paper is to analyze its development process and extract its research subject framework for reference in future research. This paper uses the systematic review method and the literature co-citation network analysis to classify the theme of sustainable tourism policy research into six categories, including: Sustainable tourism policy stakeholders, sustainable tourism policy implementation, sustainable tourism and climate policy, sustainable tourism indicators and planning, sustainable concepts in tourism policy, and the role of sustainable tourism policy. The development and implementation of sustainable tourism policies are an effective response to global environmental and sustainable development challenges. However, the current sustainable tourism policy is often economic-growth oriented, which has theoretical differences with sustainable development. At the same time, the research focus of scholars is on the impact of policies on the sustainable development of tourism, while the research on the formation process of policies and governance behaviors in the sustainable development of tourism is not enough.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b86164b6116835fb3c9be19a4821ba1dc1fd0e76,b86164b6116835fb3c9be19a4821ba1dc1fd0e76

Online Education and Its Effective Practice: A Research Review,"A. Sun, Xiufang Chen","Using a qualitative content analysis approach, this study reviewed 47 published studies and research on online teaching and learning since 2008, primarily focusing on how theories, practices and assessments apply to the online learning environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide practical suggestions for those who are planning to develop online courses so that they can make informed decisions in the implementation process. Based on the findings, the authors argued that effective online instruction is dependent upon 1) well-designed course content, motivated interaction between the instructor and learners, well-prepared and fully-supported instructors; 2) creation of a sense of online learning community; and 3) rapid advancement of technology. In doing this, it is hoped that this will stimulate an on-going discussion of effective strategies that can enhance universities and faculty success in transitioning to teach online.

"Ethics in educational research: Review boards, ethical issues and researcher development",G. Head,"Educational research, and research in the Social Sciences more generally, has experienced a growth in the introduction of ethical review boards since the 1990s. Increasingly, universities have set up ethics review procedures that require researchers to submit applications seeking approval to conduct research. Review boards and the rules and conditions under which they operate have been criticised as obstructive, unnecessarily bureaucratic, and even unethical. At the same time, review boards and their procedures have been acknowledged as contributing to consideration of the ethical conduct of research. This paper explores the issues related to ethical review and examines the wider ethical considerations that may arise during the research process. The paper concludes that a purely administrative process of review is inadequate to ensure the ethical conduct of research, especially qualitative research. Rather, it is argued that ethical research entails the resolution of a potential series of ethical dilemmas as they arise during research. As such, the ethical conduct of research is a matter of researcher formation and development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db927e8434c42a8221a8693a41d8cfe855f5fedc,db927e8434c42a8221a8693a41d8cfe855f5fedc

Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article],"E. Cambria, B. White","Natural language processing (NLP) is a theory-motivated range of computational techniques for the automatic analysis and representation of human language. NLP research has evolved from the era of punch cards and batch processing (in which the analysis of a sentence could take up to 7 minutes) to the era of Google and the likes of it (in which millions of webpages can be processed in less than a second). This review paper draws on recent developments in NLP research to look at the past, present, and future of NLP technology in a new light. Borrowing the paradigm of `jumping curves' from the field of business management and marketing prediction, this survey article reinterprets the evolution of NLP research as the intersection of three overlapping curves-namely Syntactics, Semantics, and Pragmatics Curveswhich will eventually lead NLP research to evolve into natural language understanding.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec43d37aad744150af144d27a08b0b097607e712,ec43d37aad744150af144d27a08b0b097607e712
Formal and Informal Learning in the Workplace: A Research Review,"A. Manuti, Serafina Pastore, A. Scardigno, M. Giancaspro, Daniele Morciano","The radical economic, social and cultural changes experienced by the labour market within recent decades have helped to highlight the central role played by the learning process in individual career development and organizational success. In such fast-moving working contexts, skills and competencies rapidly become outdated and need to be continuously implemented and empowered as a strategic factor for global competitiveness. Traditional models of learning both inside and outside of the workplace have become unable to explain the complexity of such a process, weaving between and overlapping formal and informal components. Starting with this premise, the aim of the present paper was to analyse the role of knowledge and experience as important learning frames, which allow the acquisition and development of competencies in the workplace. A human resource development perspective was adopted, aimed at reconciling both the organizational and individual stances implied in the process. The methodology of achieving this was to review the most recent literature on workplace learning, with a special focus on its formal and informal dimensions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a39c5691d4b3c6b188430dabd2e16be5a96d67ca,a39c5691d4b3c6b188430dabd2e16be5a96d67ca
Use of partial least squares (PLS) in strategic management research: a review of four recent studies,J. Hulland,"Advances in causal modeling techniques have made it possible for researchers to simultaneously examine theory and measures. However, researchers must use these new techniques appropriately. In addition to dealing with the methodological concerns associated with more traditional methods of analysis, researchers using causal modeling approaches must understand their underlying assumptions and limitations. Most researchers are well equipped with a basic understanding of LISREL‐type models. In contrast, current familiarity with PLS in the strategic management area is low. The current paper reviews four recent studies in the strategic management area which use PLS. The review notes that the technique has been applied inconsistently, and at times inappropriately, and suggests standards for evaluating future PLS applications.

Systematic review of research on artificial intelligence applications in higher education – where are the educators?,"Olaf Zawacki-Richter, Victoria I. Marín, Melissa Bond, Franziska Gouverneur","According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04de4d9eb0d53025c8ab6c99d1e743f4c1bc1eb6,04de4d9eb0d53025c8ab6c99d1e743f4c1bc1eb6
TRANSFER OF TRAINING: A REVIEW AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,"Timothy T. Baldwin, J. Ford","Transfer of training is of paramount concern for training researchers and practitioners. Despite research efforts, there is a growing concern over the “transfer problem.” The purpose of this paper is to provide a critique of the existing transfer research and to suggest directions for future research investigations. The conditions of transfer include both the generalization of learned material to the job and the maintenance of trained skills over a period of time on the job. The existing research examining the effects of training design, trainee, and work-environment factors on conditions of transfer is reviewed and critiqued. Research gaps identified from the review include the need to (1) test various operationalizations of training design and work-environment factors that have been posited as having an impact on transfer and (2) develop a framework for conducting research on the effects of trainee characteristics on transfer. Needed advancements in the conceptualization and operationalization of the criterion of transfer are also discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49834756b1296904f3d1e2368fcf0042dde87afc,49834756b1296904f3d1e2368fcf0042dde87afc
"The Business Case for Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review of Concepts, Research and Practice","A. Carroll, K. Shabana","In this review, the primary subject is the ‘business case’ for corporate social responsibility (CSR). The business case refers to the underlying arguments or rationales supporting or documenting why the business community should accept and advance the CSR ‘cause’. The business case is concerned with the primary question: What do the business community and organizations get out of CSR? That is, how do they benefit tangibly from engaging in CSR policies, activities and practices? The business case refers to the bottom-line financial and other reasons for businesses pursuing CSR strategies and policies. In developing this business case, the paper first provides some historical background and perspective. In addition, it provides a brief discussion of the evolving understandings of CSR and some of the long-established, traditional arguments that have been made both for and against the idea of business assuming any responsibility to society beyond profit-seeking and maximizing its own financial well-being.

"Past, present and future of Industry 4.0 - a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal","Yongxin Liao, F. Deschamps, E. Loures, L. Ramos","Over the last few years, the fourth industrial revolution has attracted more and more attentions all around the world. In the current literature, there is still a lack of efforts to systematically review the state of the art of this new industrial revolution wave. The aim of this study is to address this gap by investigating the academic progresses in Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse the academic articles within the Industry 4.0 topic that were published online until the end of June 2016. In this paper, the obtained results from both the general data analysis of included papers (e.g. relevant journals, their subject areas and categories, conferences, keywords) and the specific data analysis corresponding to four research sub-questions are illustrated and discussed. These results not only summarise the current research activities (e.g. main research directions, applied standards, employed software and hardware), but also indicate existing deficiencies and potential research directions through proposing a research agenda. Findings of this review can be used as the basis for future research in Industry 4.0 and related topics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d1540e61f184bd1eea3ad4d3d8ea9e59dd525d7,5d1540e61f184bd1eea3ad4d3d8ea9e59dd525d7
A Review of Self-regulated Learning: Six Models and Four Directions for Research,E. Panadero,"Self-regulated learning (SRL) includes the cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy, volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has become one of the most important areas of research within educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the following aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d) top–down/bottom–up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from which to conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL models in light of differences in students’ developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models and theories to enhance students’ learning and SRL skills.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1c16a276f08858ccad20e9e2ca188726fffefad,e1c16a276f08858ccad20e9e2ca188726fffefad
A systematic review and research perspective on recommender systems,"Deepjyoti Roy, M. Dutta","Recommender systems are efficient tools for filtering online information, which is widespread owing to the changing habits of computer users, personalization trends, and emerging access to the internet. Even though the recent recommender systems are eminent in giving precise recommendations, they suffer from various limitations and challenges like scalability, cold-start, sparsity, etc. Due to the existence of various techniques, the selection of techniques becomes a complex work while building application-focused recommender systems. In addition, each technique comes with its own set of features, advantages and disadvantages which raises even more questions, which should be addressed. This paper aims to undergo a systematic review on various recent contributions in the domain of recommender systems, focusing on diverse applications like books, movies, products, etc. Initially, the various applications of each recommender system are analysed. Then, the algorithmic analysis on various recommender systems is performed and a taxonomy is framed that accounts for various components required for developing an effective recommender system. In addition, the datasets gathered, simulation platform, and performance metrics focused on each contribution are evaluated and noted. Finally, this review provides a much-needed overview of the current state of research in this field and points out the existing gaps and challenges to help posterity in developing an efficient recommender system.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f139ac3658ae3f8664f713b0f2af027fa990081,7f139ac3658ae3f8664f713b0f2af027fa990081
Extending the Theory of Planned Behavior: A Review and Avenues for Further Research,"M. Conner, C. Armitage","This paper describes and reviews the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The focus is on evidence supporting the further extension of the TPB in various ways. Empirical and theoretical evidence to support the addition of 6 variables to the TPB is reviewed: belief salience measures, past behaviodhabit, perceived behavioral control (PBC) vs. selfefficacy, moral norms, self-identity, and affective beliefs. In each case there appears to be growing empirical evidence to support their addition to the TPB and some understanding of the processes by which they may be related to other TPB variables, intentions, and behavior. Two avenues for expansion of the TPB are presented. First, the possibility of incorporating the TPB into a dual-process model of attitude-behavior relationships is reviewed. Second, the expansion of the TPB to include consideration of the volitional processes determining how goal intentions may lead to goal achievement is discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5c233bc686cdad2ac9edd1c8578dcdc681dc63,2a5c233bc686cdad2ac9edd1c8578dcdc681dc63
"Entrepreneurship and Dynamic Capabilities: A Review, Model and Research Agenda","S. Zahra, H. Sapienza, P. Davidsson","The emergent literature on dynamic capabilities and their role in value creation is riddled with inconsistencies, overlapping definitions, and outright contradictions. Yet, the theoretical and practical importance of developing and applying dynamic capabilities to sustain a firm's competitive advantage in complex and volatile external environments has catapulted this issue to the forefront of the research agendas of many scholars. In this paper, we offer a definition of dynamic capabilities, separating them from substantive capabilities as well as from their antecedents and consequences. We also present a set of propositions that outline (1) how substantive capabilities and dynamic capabilities are related to one another, (2) how this relationship is moderated by organizational knowledge and skills, (3) how organizational age affects the speed of utilization of dynamic capabilities and the learning mode used in organizational change, and (4) how organizational knowledge and market dynamism affect the likely value of dynamic capabilities. Our discussion and model help to delineate key differences in the dynamic capabilities that new ventures and established companies have, revealing a key source of strategic heterogeneity between these firms.

Multiple accounts of blockchain adoption within industry were also consulted to gain further insight.FindingsWhile blockchain technologies remain in their infancy, they are gaining momentum within supply chains, trust being the predominant factor driving their adoption. The value of such technologies for supply chain management lies in four areas: extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalisation and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts. Several challenges and gaps in understanding and opportunities for further research are identified by this research. How a blockchain-enabled supply chain should be configured has also been explored from a design perspective.Research limitations/implicationsThis systematic review focuses on the diffusion of blockchain technology within supply chains, and great care was taken in selecting search terms. However, the authors acknowledge that their choice of terms may have excluded certain blockchain articles from this review.Practical implicationsThis paper offers valuable insight for supply chain practitioners into how blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt existing supply chain provisions as well as a number of challenges to its successful diffusion.Social implicationsThe paper debates the poential social and economic impact brought by blockchain.Originality/valueThis paper is one of the first studies to examine the current state of blockchain diffusion within supply chains.

"Digital transformation: a review, synthesis and opportunities for future research","S. Nadkarni, Reinhard Prügl","In the last years, scholarly attention was on a steady rise leading to a significant increase in the number of papers addressing different technological and organizational aspects of digital transformation. In this paper, we consolidate existing findings which mainly stem from the literature of information systems, map the territory by sharing important macro- and micro-level observations, and propose future research opportunities for this pervasive field. The paper systematically reviews 58 peer-reviewed studies published between 2001 and 2019, dealing with different aspects of digital transformation. Emerging from our review, we develop inductive thematic maps which identify technology and actor as the two aggregate dimensions of digital transformation. For each dimension, we derive further units of analysis (nine core themes in total) which help to disentangle the particularities of digital transformation processes and thereby emphasize the most influential and unique antecedents and consequences. In a second step, in order to assist in breaking down disciplinary silos and strengthen the management perspective, we supplement the resulting state-of-the-art of digital transformation by integrating cross-disciplinary contributions from reviewing 28 papers on technological disruption and 32 papers on corporate entrepreneurship. The review reveals that certain aspects, such as the pace of transformation, the culture and work environment, or the middle management perspective are significantly underdeveloped.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/124f05f599bdbf0f1c4887fcb75c903b37489c87,124f05f599bdbf0f1c4887fcb75c903b37489c87

In the year 2017 alone, 2082 articles were published under the key words ‘sport nutrition’. Consequently, staying current with the relevant literature is often difficult.MethodsThis paper is an ongoing update of the sports nutrition review article originally published as the lead paper to launch the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition in 2004 and updated in 2010. It presents a well-referenced overview of the current state of the science related to optimization of training and performance enhancement through exercise training and nutrition. Notably, due to the accelerated pace and size at which the literature base in this research area grows, the topics discussed will focus on muscle hypertrophy and performance enhancement. As such, this paper provides an overview of: 1.) How ergogenic aids and dietary supplements are defined in terms of governmental regulation and oversight; 2.) How dietary supplements are legally regulated in the United States; 3.) How to evaluate the scientific merit of nutritional supplements; 4.) General nutritional strategies to optimize performance and enhance recovery; and, 5.) An overview of our current understanding of nutritional approaches to augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy and the potential ergogenic value of various dietary and supplemental approaches.ConclusionsThis updated review is to provide ISSN members and individuals interested in sports nutrition with information that can be implemented in educational, research or practical settings and serve as a foundational basis for determining the efficacy and safety of many common sport nutrition products and their ingredients.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/330d9ad8ef92f78f4309fd4272808cfb6698dbd3,330d9ad8ef92f78f4309fd4272808cfb6698dbd3
Resilience in Business and Management Research: A Review of Influential Publications and a Research Agenda,M. Linnenluecke,"This paper identifies the development of and gaps in knowledge in business and management research on resilience, based on a systematic review of influential publications among 339 papers, books and book chapters published between 1977 and 2014. Analyzing these records shows that resilience research has developed into five research streams, or lines of enquiry, which view resilience as (1) organizational responses to external threats, (2) organizational reliability, (3) employee strengths, (4) the adaptability of business models or (5) design principles that reduce supply chain vulnerabilities and disruptions. A review of the five streams suggests three key findings: First, resilience has been conceptualized quite differently across studies, meaning that the different research streams have developed their own definitions, theories and understandings of resilience. Second, conceptual similarities and differences among these streams have not yet been explored, nor have insights been gleaned about any possible generalizable principles for developing resilience. Third, resilience has been operationalized quite differently, with few insights into the empirics for detecting resilience to future adversity (or the absence thereof). This paper outlines emerging research trends and pathways for future research, highlighting opportunities to integrate and expand on existing knowledge, as well as avenues for further investigation of resilience in business and management studies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d420270f5b9bc5e0b8d094a6567c0dcea7d86495,d420270f5b9bc5e0b8d094a6567c0dcea7d86495
Digital Transformation and Environmental Sustainability: A Review and Research Agenda,"Abdulhanan Feroz, Hangjung Zo, Ananth Chiravuri","Digital transformation refers to the unprecedented disruptions in society, industry, and organizations stimulated by advances in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

"Categorizing Categorization Research: Review, Integration, and Future Directions","Jean-Philippe Vergne, Tyler Wry","This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on organizational categories and categorization published in the last 14 years (1999–2012). After identifying a core of roughly 100 papers on categories that appeared in management, organization, and sociology journals, we classified them based on several key dimensions, and analysed a few trends within the categorization literature. Our most surprising finding may be the fact that until recently, there was no mutual recognition of the existence of a distinct ‘literature on categories’ despite the wealth of published material on the topic. After summarizing some core theoretical features of that emergent literature, we propose integrative definitions of its core constructs and suggest several areas of research that could further enrich it in the future.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7a2c48df3203a152b73df99551e5171a60e5e77,d7a2c48df3203a152b73df99551e5171a60e5e77

Twenty years' research on peer victimization and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies.,"David S. J. Hawker, M. Boulton","Cross-sectional quantitative designs are often used to investigate whether peer victimization is positively related to psychosocial maladjustment. This paper presents a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies, published between 1978 and 1997, of the association of peer victimization with psychosocial maladjustment. Mean effect sizes were calculated for the association between peer victimization and each form of maladjustment (depression, loneliness, generalized and social anxiety, and global and social self-worth) assessed. The results suggested that victimization is most strongly related to depression, and least strongly related to anxiety. There was no evidence that victimization is more strongly related to social than to psychological forms of maladjustment. Effect sizes were stronger when the same informants were used to assess both victimization and maladjustment than when different informants were used. There were some design limitations to the studies reviewed, but all together their results provide a strong background for more complex research into the course and treatment of victims' distress.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07c24f3010fea830bca6692595caea13edfa94a8,07c24f3010fea830bca6692595caea13edfa94a8

A Transdisciplinary Review of Deep Learning Research and Its Relevance for Water Resources Scientists,Chaopeng Shen,"Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem‐relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image‐like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation‐based analysis, inversion of network‐extracted features, reduced‐order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem‐specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7e5cca32ea7d7ae8e095a11549f6c7918148b15,b7e5cca32ea7d7ae8e095a11549f6c7918148b15

Specifically, callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., lack of guilt, absence of empathy, callous use of others) seem to be relatively stable across childhood and adolescence and they designate a group of youth with a particularly severe, aggressive, and stable pattern of antisocial behavior. Further, antisocial youth with CU traits show a number of distinct emotional, cognitive, and personality characteristics compared to other antisocial youth. These characteristics of youth with CU traits have important implications for causal models of antisocial and aggressive behavior, for methods used to study antisocial youth, and for assessing and treating antisocial and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f71a3752c489d5a5dcb8bba765409855d70971,46f71a3752c489d5a5dcb8bba765409855d70971

It requires companies to design their business model (i.e., the value network, the relationships with the supply chain partners, and the value propositions towards customers) around a new concept of sustainable development that reduces consumption of natural resources and preserves the environment. However, extant research falls short in terms of explaining how companies design their business model according to the circular economy principles.

Borg,"This paper reviews a selection of research from the field of foreign and second language teaching into what is referred to here as teacher cognition – what teachers think, know, and believe and the relationships of these mental constructs to what teachers do in the language teaching classroom. Within a framework suggested by more general mainstream educational research on teacher cognition, language teacher cognition is here discussed with reference to three main themes: (1) cognition and prior language learning experience, (2) cognition and teacher education, and (3) cognition and classroom practice. In addition, the findings of studies into two specific curricular areas in language teaching which have been examined by teacher cognition – grammar teaching and literacy – are discussed. This review indicates that, while the study of teacher cognition has established itself on the research agenda in the field of language teaching and provided valuable insight into the mental lives of language teachers, a clear sense of unity is lacking in the work and there are several major issues in language teaching which have yet to be explored from the perspective of teacher cognition.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aad85e4f7d46066ec178a1ffe8c3d69b4247a577,aad85e4f7d46066ec178a1ffe8c3d69b4247a577

"Decarbonization in Shipping Industry: A Review of Research, Technology Development, and Innovation Proposals","George Mallouppas, E. Yfantis","This review paper examines the possible pathways and possible technologies available that will help the shipping sector achieve the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) deep decarbonization targets by 2050. There has been increased interest from important stakeholders regarding deep decarbonization, evidenced by market surveys conducted by Shell and Deloitte. However, deep decarbonization will require financial incentives and policies at an international and regional level given the maritime sector’s ~3% contribution to green house gas (GHG) emissions. The review paper, based on research articles and grey literature, discusses technoeconomic problems and/or benefits for technologies that will help the shipping sector achieve the IMO’s targets. The review presents a discussion on the recent literature regarding alternative fuels (nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol), renewable energy sources (biofuels, wind, solar), the maturity of technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines) as well as technical and operational strategies to reduce fuel consumption for new and existing ships (slow steaming, cleaning and coating, waste heat recovery, hull and propeller design). The IMO’s 2050 targets will be achieved via radical technology shift together with the aid of social pressure, financial incentives, regulatory and legislative reforms at the local, regional and international level.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16adff4e354a3c37e15d2fbef1c2fba34c290135,16adff4e354a3c37e15d2fbef1c2fba34c290135

"A systematic literature review on entrepreneurial intentions: citation, thematic analyses, and research agenda","F. Liñán, A. Fayolle","Entrepreneurial intention is a rapidly evolving field of research. A growing number of studies use entrepreneurial intention as a powerful theoretical framework. However, a substantial part of this research lacks systematization and categorization, and there seems to be a tendency to start anew with every study. Therefore, there is a need to take stock of current knowledge in this field. In this sense, this paper carries out a review of the literature on entrepreneurial intentions. A total of 409 papers addressing entrepreneurial intention, published between 2004 and 2013 (inclusive), have been analyzed. The purpose and contribution of this paper is to offer a clearer picture of the sub-fields in entrepreneurial intention research, by concentrating on two aspects. Firstly, it reviews recent research by means of a citation analysis to categorize the main areas of specialization currently attracting the attention of the academic community. Secondly, a thematic analysis is carried out to identify the specific themes being researched within each category. Despite the large number of publications and their diversity, the present study identifies five main research areas, plus an additional sixth category for a number of new research papers that cannot be easily classified into the five areas. Within those categories, up to twenty-five different themes are recognized. A number of research gaps are singled out within each of these areas of specialization, in order to induce new ways and perspectives in the entrepreneurial intention field of research that may be fruitful in filling these gaps.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2cd77233ebcbd95c775a9b8a128ff4b4d925767,c2cd77233ebcbd95c775a9b8a128ff4b4d925767
Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review,"Zhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng, Shou-tao Xu, Xindong Wu","Due to object detection’s close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7998468d99ab07bb982294d1c9b53a3bf3934fa6,7998468d99ab07bb982294d1c9b53a3bf3934fa6
Research on Resilience of Power Systems Under Natural Disasters—A Review,"Yezhou Wang, Chen Chen, Jianhui Wang, R. Baldick","Natural disasters can cause large blackouts.

Big data analytics in E-commerce: a systematic review and agenda for future research,"Shahriar Akter, S. Wamba","There has been an increasing emphasis on big data analytics (BDA) in e-commerce in recent years. However, it remains poorly-explored as a concept, which obstructs its theoretical and practical development. This position paper explores BDA in e-commerce by drawing on a systematic review of the literature. The paper presents an interpretive framework that explores the definitional aspects, distinctive characteristics, types, business value and challenges of BDA in the e-commerce landscape. The paper also triggers broader discussions regarding future research challenges and opportunities in theory and practice.

Green Human Resource Management: A Review and Research Agenda,"D. E. Renwick, T. Redman, S. Maguire","The paper makes a case for the integration of the largely separate literatures of environmental management (EM) and human resource management (HRM) research. The paper categorizes the existing literature on the basis of Ability–Motivation– Opportunity (AMO) theory, revealing the role that Green human resource management (GHRM) processes play in people-management practice. The contributions of the paper lie in drawing together the extant literature in the area, mapping the terrain of the field, identifying some gaps in the existing literature and suggesting some potentially fruitful future research agendas. The findings of the review suggest that understanding of how GHRM practices influence employee motivation to become involved in environmental activities lags behind that of how organizations develop Green abilities and provide employees with opportunities to be involved in EM organizational efforts. Organizations are not using the full range of GHRM practices, and this may limit their effectiveness in efforts to improve EM.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/646d0680ebce68256b43219f1d9be6db7fe3fcd2,646d0680ebce68256b43219f1d9be6db7fe3fcd2

Although their deployment is rapidly growing, there are still many challenges to efficiently design, control, and operate microgrids when connected to the grid, and also when in islanded mode, where extensive research activities are underway to tackle these issues. It is necessary to have an across-the-board view of the microgrid integration in power systems.

Sampling in software engineering research: a critical review and guidelines,"Sebastian Baltes, P. Ralph","Representative sampling appears rare in empirical software engineering research. Not all studies need representative samples, but a general lack of representative sampling undermines a scientific field. This article therefore reports a critical review of the state of sampling in recent, high-quality software engineering research. The key findings are: (1) random sampling is rare; (2) sophisticated sampling strategies are very rare; (3) sampling, representativeness and randomness often appear misunderstood. These findings suggest that software engineering research has a generalizability crisis. To address these problems, this paper synthesizes existing knowledge of sampling into a succinct primer and proposes extensive guidelines for improving the conduct, presentation and evaluation of sampling in software engineering research. It is further recommended that while researchers should strive for more representative samples, disparaging non-probability sampling is generally capricious and particularly misguided for predominately qualitative research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/849a6be5adf1b9a2b6e59ba0290bca06692c0efd,849a6be5adf1b9a2b6e59ba0290bca06692c0efd
Information Privacy Research: An Interdisciplinary Review,"H. J. Smith, Tamara Dinev, Heng Xu","To date, many important threads of information privacy research have developed, but these threads have not been woven together into a cohesive fabric. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual, group, organizational, and societal. 
 
Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. 
 
As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies-both positivist and interpretive--could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents → Privacy Concerns → Outcomes).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d7c226c14c8b551278c5dbb649701e8a2f21ba7,5d7c226c14c8b551278c5dbb649701e8a2f21ba7

Many researchers have reported that the NIR technique is useful for detection of both chemical and physical properties of wood materials and has been widely used in cases where the characteristic cellular structure of the material is retained. With regard to application of NIR spectroscopy to pulp and paper, many publications have reported its potential as an on-line measurement technique during paper-making process control. NIR spectroscopy is considered fundamental in applied research on wood and paper. Utilization of NIR spectroscopy in the wood and paper industry should take into account its applicability and limitations as a nondestructive technique.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d6986c420376152e5a17a3deb71cb6ccd6a7805,6d6986c420376152e5a17a3deb71cb6ccd6a7805

Human resource management and performance: a review and research agenda,D. Guest,"There is a growing body of evidence supporting an association between what are termed high performance or high commitment human resource management (HRM) practices and various measures of organizational performance. However, it is not clear why this association exists. This paper argues that to provide a convincing explanation of this association we need to improve our theoretical and analytic frameworks in three key areas. These are the nature of HRM, and especially the rationale for the specific lists of HR practices; the nature of organizational performance; and the linkage between HRM and performance. A model is presented within which to explore these linkages. The existing literature on HRM and performance is reviewed in the light of this analysis to identify key gaps in knowledge and help to focus further the research priorities.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b57cdd2b55e8a42978f34c670b3646c3f97526d,3b57cdd2b55e8a42978f34c670b3646c3f97526d

The impact of perception and presence on emotional reactions: a review of research in virtual reality,"J. Diemer, G. Alpers, Henrik M. Peperkorn, Y. Shiban, A. Mühlberger","Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba,ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba

Accordingly, we investigated how zero defect manufacturing was implemented and evaluated the main research patterns in the sample by analysing key factors. Based on the extensive review of the zero defect manufacturing literature, we identified and highlighted four distinctive strategies based on overarching themes for zero defect manufacturing, i.e. detection, repair, prediction, and prevention. Evaluation of current research and descriptive analysis highlighted six major shortcomings of current research in zero defect manufacturing: (i) focus on a single strategy instead of a holistic approach for global optima; (ii) certain industries are under-researched; (iii) full potential of industry-academia collaboration is not achieved; (iv) not enough focus on the beginning of manufacturing lifecycle; (v) cost–benefit comparative analysis is not evident; (vi) standard and clear definition of terms are missing.

This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding.

Transformational Leadership and Employee Psychological Well-Being: A Review and Directions for Future Research,Kara A. Arnold,"This review paper focuses on answering 2 research questions: (a) Does transformational leadership predict employee well-being? (b) If so, how and when does this prediction occur? A systematic computerized search and review of empirical papers published between January 1980 and December 2015 was conducted. Forty papers were found that met the criteria of reporting empirical results, being published in English, and focused on answering the above research questions. Based on these papers it appears that, in general, transformational leadership positively predicts positive measures of well-being, and negatively predicts negative measures of well-being (i.e., ill-being). However, recent findings suggest that this is not always such a simple relationship. In addition, several mediating variables have been established, demonstrating that in many cases there is an indirect effect of transformational leadership on employee well-being. Although some boundary conditions have been examined, more research is needed on moderators. The review demonstrated the importance of moving forward in this area with stronger research designs to determine causality, specifying the outcome variable of interest, investigating the dimensions of transformational leadership separately, and testing more complicated relationships.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b30bb744a78595b2f0f2755e354d503dacd2bc3,4b30bb744a78595b2f0f2755e354d503dacd2bc3
Review: A Review of Culture in Information Systems Research: Toward a Theory of Information Technology Culture Conflict,"D. Leidner, Timothy R. Kayworth","An understanding of culture is important to the study of information technologies in that culture at various levels, including national, organizational, and group, can influence the successful implementation and use of information technology. Culture also plays a role in managerial processes that may directly, or indirectly, influence IT. Culture is a challenging variable to research, in part because of the multiple divergent definitions and measures of culture. Notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on the relationship of IT and culture. This paper sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the linkages between IT and culture. We begin by conceptualizing culture and laying the groundwork for a values-based approach to the examination of IT and culture. Using this approach, we then provide a comprehensive review of the organizational and cross-cultural IT literature that conceptually links these two traditionally separate streams of research. From our analysis, we develop six themes of IT-culture research emphasizing culture's impact on IT, IT's impact on culture, and IT culture. Building upon these themes, we then develop a theory of IT, values, and conflict. Based upon the theory, we develop propositions concerning three types of cultural conflict and the results of these conflicts. Ultimately, the theory suggests that the reconciliation of these conflicts results in a reorientation of values. We conclude with the particular research challenges posed in this line of inquiry.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b8fe767239a34e25e71e99bd8b8a64f8279d7f4,6b8fe767239a34e25e71e99bd8b8a64f8279d7f4

Clinician‐administered PTSD scale: A review of the first ten years of research,"F. Weathers, T. Keane, J. Davidson","The Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic status and symptom severity. In the 10 years since it was developed, the CAPS has become a standard criterion measure in the field of traumatic stress and has now been used in more than 200 studies. In this paper, we first trace the history of the CAPS and provide an update on recent developments. Then we review the empirical literature, summarizing and evaluating the findings regarding the psychometric properties of the CAPS. The research evidence indicates that the CAPS has excellent reliability, yielding consistent scores across items, raters, and testing occasions. There is also strong evidence of validity: The CAPS has excellent convergent and discriminant validity, diagnostic utility, and sensitivity to clinical change. Finally, we address several concerns about the CAPS and offer recommendations for optimizing the CAPS for various clinical research applications.

A review of the recent research on vibration energy harvesting via bistable systems,"R. Harne, Kon-Well Wang","The investigation of the conversion of vibrational energy into electrical power has become a major field of research. In recent years, bistable energy harvesting devices have attracted significant attention due to some of their unique features. Through a snap-through action, bistable systems transition from one stable state to the other, which could cause large amplitude motion and dramatically increase power generation. Due to their nonlinear characteristics, such devices may be effective across a broad-frequency bandwidth. Consequently, a rapid engagement of research has been undertaken to understand bistable electromechanical dynamics and to utilize the insight for the development of improved designs. This paper reviews, consolidates, and reports on the major efforts and findings documented in the literature. A common analytical framework for bistable electromechanical dynamics is presented, the principal results are provided, the wide variety of bistable energy harvesters are described, and some remaining challenges and proposed solutions are summarized.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63e52c4196b09e7cd6d00a7fd21a60a03cb6d581,63e52c4196b09e7cd6d00a7fd21a60a03cb6d581

A systematic review of empirical research on self-reported racism and health.,Y. Paradies,"This paper reviews 138 empirical quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism and health. These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69c0877a5f33f39d4279bc6b30c859f91eaefc70,69c0877a5f33f39d4279bc6b30c859f91eaefc70

Learning under Concept Drift: A Review,"Jie Lu, Anjin Liu, Fan Dong, Feng Gu, João Gama, Guangquan Zhang","Concept drift describes unforeseeable changes in the underlying distribution of streaming data over time. Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding, and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed. To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift.

Lean manufacturing: literature review and research issues,"J. Bhamu, K. S. Sangwan","Purpose 
 
 
 
– The advent of recession at the beginning of twenty-first century forced many organizations worldwide to reduce cost and to be more responsive to customer demands. Lean Manufacturing (LM) has been widely perceived by industry as an answer to these requirements because LM reduces waste without additional requirements of resources. This led to a spurt in LM research across the globe mostly through empirical and exploratory studies which resulted in a plethora of LM definitions with divergent scopes, objectives, performance indicators, tools/techniques/methodologies, and concepts/elements. The purpose of this paper is to review LM literature and report these divergent definitions, scopes, objectives, and tools/techniques/methodologies. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– This paper highlights various definitions by various researchers and practitioners.

Muscle dysmorphia and the DSM-V conundrum: where does it belong? A review paper.,"S. Murray, E. Rieger, S. Touyz, Yolanda De la Garza García Lic","OBJECTIVE
Muscle dysmorphia is a relatively recently identified psychological condition that, since its inception, has been variously conceptualized as an eating disorder and subsequently as a type of body dysmorphic disorder within the somatoform disorders. This review aims to inform and encourage ongoing debate surrounding the diagnostic placement of this disorder.


METHOD
We present a review and synthesis of the extant literature with a view to informing future decisions regarding the conceptualization of muscle dysmorphia.


RESULTS
The validity of muscle dysmorphia as a clinical entity has been empirically demonstrated. While the condition bears little semblance to somatization as currently conceptualized, the research suggests a strong conceptual similarity with anorexia nervosa. However, future research needs to utilize more appropriate measures of male eating disorder pathology. Muscle dysmorphia is also inclusive of obsessive compulsive features that are typical to those seen in eating disorder presentations.


DISCUSSION
We suggest that muscle dysmorphia be reanalyzed through the lens of an eating disorder spectrum. Recognition of muscle dysmorphia as an eating disorder may offer more clinical utility in recognizing the male experience of eating disorder pathology and also help reduce the number of current male cases falling into the EDNOS category.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d10308795885c0361de5bf8039cbbe39c5e6d6c4,d10308795885c0361de5bf8039cbbe39c5e6d6c4

After defining the terms religion and spirituality, this paper reviews research on the relation between religion and (or) spirituality, and mental health, focusing on depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, and substance abuse. The results of an earlier systematic review are discussed, and more recent studies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries are described. While religious beliefs and practices can represent powerful sources of comfort, hope, and meaning, they are often intricately entangled with neurotic and psychotic disorders, sometimes making it difficult to determine whether they are a resource or a liability.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/192d21b5b850da7bc295d98318f15838b0a10c8d,192d21b5b850da7bc295d98318f15838b0a10c8d

Does Gamification Work? -- A Literature Review of Empirical Studies on Gamification,"Juho Hamari, Jonna Koivisto, Harri Sarsa","This paper reviews peer-reviewed empirical studies on gamification. We create a framework for examining the effects of gamification by drawing from the definitions of gamification and the discussion on motivational affordances. The literature review covers results, independent variables (examined motivational affordances), dependent variables (examined psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification), the contexts of gamification, and types of studies performed on the gamified systems. The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0768149ce1170691bcde8b4539153a282f0cc74c,0768149ce1170691bcde8b4539153a282f0cc74c
Gender stereotypes in advertising: a review of current research,"Stacy Landreth Grau, Y. Zotos","The purpose of this paper is to highlight the historical context of gender stereotypes in advertising and then examine the scholarship related to gender stereotypes. Gender portrayals in advertising have been examined extensively in the last five decades and still remain an important topic. Changing role structure in the family and in the labor force has brought significant variation in both male and female roles and subsequently how it is reflected in advertising. It has been noted that there is a culture lag. Sexes for a long period of time were depicted in advertising in more traditional roles. Women were presented in an inferior manner relative to their potential and capabilities, while at the same the data indicated a shift towards more positive role portrayals. The changing role of men is the area that has seen the greatest interest in the past few years. Men are depicted in advertising in ‘softer’ roles, while interacting with their children. Men are also shown in more egalitarian roles. The paper finally attempts to outline the future research direction of gender portrayals in advertising. First, research should focus on examining gender portrayals in online platforms, and find ways to modify current coding schemes to digital formats. Second, companies and the media are beginning to pay attention to a once largely ignored segment the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender (LGBT) consumer. Third, recent advertising has focused on the ‘empowered’ women called femvertising.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0e45532ba4945ddb2f03787705d86838bfff04d,f0e45532ba4945ddb2f03787705d86838bfff04d
Privacy in the Digital Age: A Review of Information Privacy Research in Information Systems,"F. Bélanger, Robert E. Crossler","Information privacy refers to the desire of individuals to control or have some influence over data about themselves. Advances in information technology have raised concerns about information privacy and its impacts, and have motivated Information Systems researchers to explore information privacy issues, including technical solutions to address these concerns. In this paper, we inform researchers about the current state of information privacy research in IS through a critical analysis of the IS literature that considers information privacy as a key construct. The review of the literature reveals that information privacy is a multilevel concept, but rarely studied as such. We also find that information privacy research has been heavily reliant on studentbased and USA-centric samples, which results in findings of limited generalizability. Information privacy research focuses on explaining and predicting theoretical contributions, with few studies in journal articles focusing on design and action contributions. We recommend that future research should consider different levels of analysis as well as multilevel effects of information privacy. We illustrate this with a multilevel framework for information privacy concerns. We call for research on information privacy to use a broader diversity of sampling populations, and for more design and action information privacy research to be published in journal articles that can result in IT artifacts for protection or control of information privacy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b98e0e42fb045bb920e0564e1a03d6e9a9448ec9,b98e0e42fb045bb920e0564e1a03d6e9a9448ec9
Partial least squares structural equation modeling in HRM research,"C. Ringle, M. Sarstedt, Rebecca Mitchell, S. Gudergan","Abstract Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key multivariate analysis technique that human resource management (HRM) researchers frequently use. While most disciplines undertake regular critical reflections on the use of important methods to ensure rigorous research and publication practices, the use of PLS-SEM in HRM has not been analyzed so far. To address this gap in HRM literature, this paper presents a critical review of PLS-SEM use in 77 HRM studies published over a 30-year period in leading journals.

Systematic literature searches were performed on CINAHL, MediText, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. It was found that the majority of migrants enjoy better health than the Australian-born population in the conditions that are part of the NHPAs, with the exception of diabetes. Mediterranean migrants have particularly favorable health outcomes. The migrant health advantage appears to deteriorate with increasing duration of residence. Many of the analyzed studies were conducted more than 10 years ago or had a narrow focus.

Advances in High Energy Materials (Review Paper),"U. R. Nair, S. N. Asthana, A. S. Rao, B. Gandhe","Research and development efforts for realizing higher performance levels of high energy materials (HEMs) are continued unabated all over the globe. Of late, it is becoming increasingly necessary to ensure that such materials are also eco-friendly. This has provided thrust to research in the area of force multiplying HEMs and compounds free from pollution causing components. Enhancement of the performance necessitates introduction of strained structure or increase in oxygen balance to achieve near stoichiometry. The search for environment friendly molecules is focused on chlorine free propellant compositions and lead free primary explosives. Energetic polymers offer added advantage of partitioning of energy and thus not necessitating the concentration of only solid components (HEMs and metal fuels) in the formulations, to achieve higher performance, thereby leading to improvement in energetics without adversely affecting the processability and mechanical properties. During recent times, research in the area of insensitive explosives has received impetus particularly with the signature of STANAG. This paper gives a review of the all-round advances in the areas of HEMs encompassing oxidizers, high-energy dense materials, insensitive high-energy materials, polymers and plasticizers.

Paper 2: Performing rapid reviews,"V. King, A. Stevens, B. Nussbaumer-Streit, Chris Kamel, C. Garritty","Background Health policy-makers must often make decisions in compressed time frames and with limited resources. Hence, rapid reviews have become a pragmatic alternative to comprehensive systematic reviews. However, it is important that rapid review methods remain rigorous to support good policy development and decisions. There is currently little evidence about which streamlined steps in a rapid review are less likely to introduce unacceptable levels of uncertainty while still producing a product that remains useful to policy-makers. Methods This paper summarizes current research describing commonly used methods and practices that are used to conduct rapid reviews and presents key considerations and options to guide methodological choices for a rapid review. Results The most important step for a rapid review is for an experienced research team to have early and ongoing engagement with the people who have requested the review. A clear research protocol, derived from a needs assessment conducted with the requester, serves to focus the review, defines the scope of the rapid review, and guides all subsequent steps. Common recommendations for rapid review methods include tailoring the literature search in terms of databases, dates, and languages. Researchers can consider using a staged search to locate high-quality systematic reviews and then subsequently published primary studies. The approaches used for study screening and selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment should be tailored to the topic, researcher experience, and available resources. Many rapid reviews use a single reviewer for study selection, risk-of-bias assessment, or data abstraction, sometimes with partial or full verification by a second reviewer. Rapid reviews usually use a descriptive synthesis method rather than quantitative meta-analysis. Use of brief report templates and standardized production methods helps to speed final report publication. Conclusions Researchers conducting rapid reviews need to make transparent methodological choices, informed by stakeholder input, to ensure that rapid reviews meet their intended purpose. Transparency is critical because it is unclear how or how much streamlined methods can bias the conclusions of reviews. There are not yet internationally accepted standards for conducting or reporting rapid reviews. Thus, this article proposes interim guidance for researchers who are increasingly employing these methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ee323172df55a1358dd03346627c22c52a88a620,ee323172df55a1358dd03346627c22c52a88a620

Review Paper. Ancient DNA,"E. Willerslev, A. Cooper","In the past two decades, ancient DNA research has progressed from the retrieval of small fragments of mitochondrial DNA from a few late Holocene specimens, to large-scale studies of ancient populations, phenotypically important nuclear loci, and even whole mitochondrial genome sequences of extinct species. However, the field is still regularly marred by erroneous reports, which underestimate the extent of contamination within laboratories and samples themselves. An improved understanding of these processes and the effects of damage on ancient DNA templates has started to provide a more robust basis for research. Recent methodological advances have included the characterization of Pleistocene mammal populations and discoveries of DNA preserved in ancient sediments. Increasingly, ancient genetic information is providing a unique means to test assumptions used in evolutionary and population genetics studies to reconstruct the past. Initial results have revealed surprisingly complex population histories, and indicate that modern phylogeographic studies may give misleading impressions about even the recent evolutionary past. With the advent and uptake of appropriate methodologies, ancient DNA is now positioned to become a powerful tool in biological research and is also evolving new and unexpected uses, such as in the search for extinct or extant life in the deep biosphere and on other planets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1863694f99a1e120514ea01b1a06bc6fed3cd32c,1863694f99a1e120514ea01b1a06bc6fed3cd32c

Matching methods for causal inference: A review and a look forward.,E. Stuart,"When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c104df9aabcd2e38345cbf5387b1bb4acc38ccc0,c104df9aabcd2e38345cbf5387b1bb4acc38ccc0

The integrative review: updated methodology.,"R. Whittemore, K. Knafl","AIM
The aim of this paper is to distinguish the integrative review method from other review methods and to propose methodological strategies specific to the integrative review method to enhance the rigour of the process.


BACKGROUND
Recent evidence-based practice initiatives have increased the need for and the production of all types of reviews of the literature (integrative reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and qualitative reviews). The integrative review method is the only approach that allows for the combination of diverse methodologies (for example, experimental and non-experimental research), and has the potential to play a greater role in evidence-based practice for nursing. With respect to the integrative review method, strategies to enhance data collection and extraction have been developed; however, methods of analysis, synthesis, and conclusion drawing remain poorly formulated.


DISCUSSION
A modified framework for research reviews is presented to address issues specific to the integrative review method. Issues related to specifying the review purpose, searching the literature, evaluating data from primary sources, analysing data, and presenting the results are discussed. Data analysis methods of qualitative research are proposed as strategies that enhance the rigour of combining diverse methodologies as well as empirical and theoretical sources in an integrative review.


CONCLUSION
An updated integrative review method has the potential to allow for diverse primary research methods to become a greater part of evidence-based practice initiatives.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1af41489312a49e94d2e3ce1c58faf3a5bc8ef8,e1af41489312a49e94d2e3ce1c58faf3a5bc8ef8

To understand the impact of CPOE on clinical workflow, we developed a conceptual framework and conducted a literature search for CPOE evaluations between 1990 and June 2007. Fifty-one publications were identified that disclosed mixed effects of CPOE systems. Among the frequently reported workflow advantages were the legible orders, remote accessibility of the systems, and the shorter order turnaround times. Among the frequently reported disadvantages were the time-consuming and problematic user-system interactions, and the enforcement of a predefined relationship between clinical tasks and between providers. Regarding the diversity of findings in the literature, we conclude that more multi-method research is needed to explore CPOE's multidimensional and collective impact on especially collaborative workflow.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f535b3ea7366d9f0af422d3cd3614ad3399ec0d,0f535b3ea7366d9f0af422d3cd3614ad3399ec0d
Measuring trust in organisational research: Review and recommendations,"Bill McEvily, M. Tortoriello","Abstract Although the organisational literature is increasingly converging on common definitions and theoretical conceptualisations of trust, it is unclear whether the same is true for the measures used to operationalise trust. In this paper, we review the organisational literature to assess the degree of sophistication and convergence across studies in how trust has been measured. Our analysis of 171 papers published over 48 years revealed that the state of the art of trust measurement is rudimentary and highly fragmented. In particular, we identified a total of 129 different measures of trust. Moreover, in only 24 instances were we able to verify that a previously developed and validated measure of trust had been replicated verbatim, and 11 of these replications were by the same authors who originated the measure. In addition to the limited degree of replication, the measurement of trust in the organisational literature is characterised by weak evidence in support of construct validity and limited consensus on operational dimensions. What makes these findings even more surprising is that our review also identified several measures of trust that have been carefully developed and thoroughly validated. We profile those measures with strong measurement properties and discuss their trade-offs. We also present a framework for measuring trust that provides guidance to researchers for selecting or developing a measure of trust and propose an agenda for future research with an emphasis on resolving enduring debates in the literature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/408ef5d906e1682df0745d1fc84a99a068536a4c,408ef5d906e1682df0745d1fc84a99a068536a4c
Multi-agent systems applications in manufacturing systems and supply chain management: a review paper,"J. Lee, C.-O.

The objective of the paper is twofold. First, it presents a comprehensive literature review of current multi-agent systems (MAS) research applications in the field of manufacturing systems and SCM. Second, it aims to identify and evaluate some key issues involved in using MAS methods to model and simulate manufacturing systems. A variety of different MAS applications are reviewed in three different classified research areas: production design and development, production planning and control, and SCM. In presenting a detailed taxonomy of MAS applications, the paper describes MAS application domains from five different perspectives. The review suggests the MAS approach represents a feasible framework for designing and analysing real-time manufacturing operations, since the approach is capable of modelling different levels of agent behaviour and dynamical interactions. The paper also highlights a number of key issues which have to be taken into account in attempting to design MAS-based research paradigms for future applications in manufacturing systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe10e48942c285023311e3fdfba1093b9d884890,fe10e48942c285023311e3fdfba1093b9d884890

Review Paper: Materials and Techniques for In Vivo pH Monitoring,"O. Korostynska, K. Arshak, E. Gill, A. Arshak","Advances in semiconductor sensor technology, medical diagnostics, and health care needs a rapid boost in research into novel miniaturized pH sensors, which can be used in vivo for continuous patient monitoring. Requirements for the in vivo sensor are materials biocompatibility, high measurement precision, a response time of an order of less than seconds, and the possibility of continuous 24-h monitoring. Monitoring of the pH values is important in the study of tissue metabolism, in neurophysiology, cancer diagnostics, and so forth. Muscle pH can be used to triage and help treat trauma victims as well as to indicate poor peripheral blood flow in diabetic patients. Clearly, to avoid infection and spread of diseases, all in vivo monitoring devices should be single-use/disposable, which puts strict requirement on their price. This paper reviews the wide range of methods and materials used for in vivo measurement of pH levels, such as using the optical fibers, pH-sensitive polymers, ion-sensitive field effect transistors, near infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fluorescent pH indicators.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8656783f849ec68df65cba9b477c587717183c10,8656783f849ec68df65cba9b477c587717183c10
Annual Research Review: Parenting and children's brain development: the end of the beginning.,"J. Belsky, Michelle de Haan","After questioning the practical significance of evidence that parenting influences brain development - while highlighting the scientific importance of such work for understanding how family experience shapes human development - this paper reviews evidence suggesting that brain structure and function are 'chiselled' by parenting. Although the generalisability of most findings is limited due to a disproportionate, but understandable focus on clinical samples (e.g., maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and causal inferences are difficult to draw because of the observational nature of most of the evidence, it is noteworthy that some work with community samples and very new experimental work (e.g., parent training) suggests that tentative conclusions regarding effects of parenting on the developing brain may well be substantiated in future research. Such efforts should focus on parenting in the normal range, experimental manipulations of parenting, differential susceptibility to parenting effects and pathway models linking parenting to brain development and, thereby, to behavioural development. Research on parenting and children's brain development may be regarded as at 'the end of the beginning'.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea4e86f86d0f21075f4fbf4fcda7411e3c3ba6b3,ea4e86f86d0f21075f4fbf4fcda7411e3c3ba6b3
Review paper: Surface Modification for Bioimplants: The Role of Laser Surface Engineering,"A. Kurella, N. Dahotre","Often hard implants undergo detachment from the host tissue due to inadequate biocompatibility and poor osteointegration. Changing surface chemistry and physical topography of the surface influences biocompatibility. At present, the understanding of biocompatibility of both virgin and modified surfaces of bioimplant materials is limited and a great deal of research is being dedicated to this aspect. In view of this, the current review casts new light on research related to the surface modification of biomaterials, especially materials for prosthetic applications. A brief overview of the major surface modification techniques has been presented, followed by an in-depth discussion on laser surface modifications that have been explored so far along with those that hold tremendous potential for bioimplant applications.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/719176b1accddc87353931ac45d5358994255aa2,719176b1accddc87353931ac45d5358994255aa2
The applications of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing context: a systematic literature review,"T. Zheng, M. Ardolino, A. Bacchetti, M. Perona","Industry 4.0 (I4.0) encompasses a plethora of digital technologies effecting on manufacturing enterprises. Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d81a77931ed68dc956fea907623dc0975ed988e3,d81a77931ed68dc956fea907623dc0975ed988e3

Green Supply-Chain Management: A State-of-the-Art Literature Review,S. K. Srivastava,"There is a growing need for integrating environmentally sound choices into supply-chain management research and practice. Perusal of the literature shows that a broad frame of reference for green supply-chain management (GrSCM) is not adequately developed. Regulatory bodies that formulate regulations to meet societal and ecological concerns to facilitate growth of business and economy also suffer from its absence. A succinct classification to help academicians, researchers and practitioners in understanding integrated GrSCM from a wider perspective is needed. Further, sufficient literature is available to warrant such classification. This paper takes an integrated and fresh look into the area of GrSCM. The literature on GrSCM is covered exhaustively from its conceptualization, primarily taking a 'reverse logistics angle'. Using the rich body of available literature, including earlier reviews that had relatively limited perspectives, the literature on GrSCM is classified on the basis of the problem context in supply chain's major influential areas. It is also classified on the basis of methodology and approach adopted. Various mathematical tools/techniques used in literature vis-a-vis the contexts of GrSCM are mapped. A timeline indicating relevant papers is also provided as a ready reference.

Review Paper: The Effects of Promoting Patient Access to Medical Records: A Review,"S. Ross, Chen-Tan Lin","The Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPPA) stipulates that patients must be permitted to review and amend their medical records. As information technology makes medical records more accessible to patients, it may become more commonplace for patients to review their records routinely. This article analyzes the potential benefits and drawbacks of facilitating patient access to the medical record by reviewing previously published research. Previous research includes analysis of clinical notes, surveys of patients and practitioners, and studies of patient-accessible medical records. Overall, studies suggest the potential for modest benefits (for instance, in enhancing doctor-patient communication). Risks (for instance, increasing patient worry or confusion) appear to be minimal in medical patients. The studies, however, were of limited quality and low statistical power to detect the variety of outcomes that may result from implementation of a patient-accessible medical record.

A Review of Motion Planning Techniques for Automated Vehicles,"D. González, Joshué Pérez, V. M. Montero, F. Nashashibi","Intelligent vehicles have increased their capabilities for highly and, even fully, automated driving under controlled environments. Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years.

Managing Social-Business Tensions: A Review and Research Agenda for Social Enterprise,"Wendy K. Smith, M. Gonin, Marya L. Besharov","ABSTRACT: In a world filled with poverty, environmental degradation, and moral injustice, social enterprises offer a ray of hope. These organizations seek to achieve social missions through business ventures. Yet social missions and business ventures are associated with divergent goals, values, norms, and identities. Attending to them simultaneously creates tensions, competing demands, and ethical dilemmas. Effectively understanding social enterprises therefore depends on insight into the nature and management of these tensions. While existing research recognizes tensions between social missions and business ventures, we lack any systematic analysis. Our paper addresses this issue. We first categorize the types of tensions that arise between social missions and business ventures, emphasizing their prevalence and variety. We then explore how four different organizational theories offer insight into these tensions, and we develop an agenda for future research. We end by arguing that a focus on social-business tensions not only expands insight into social enterprises, but also provides an opportunity for research on social enterprises to inform traditional organizational theories. Taken together, our analysis of tensions in social enterprises integrates and seeks to energize research on this expanding phenomenon.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28fd8d035b5250f553af4ef377dea5d05a782815,28fd8d035b5250f553af4ef377dea5d05a782815

Review Paper: Coding Systems in Health Care,J. Cimino,"Abstract: Computer-based patient data which are represented in a coded form have a variety of uses, including direct patient care, statistical reporting, automated decision support, and clinical research. No standard exists which supports all of these functions. Abstracting coding systems, such as ICD, CPT, DRGs and MeSH fail to provide adequate detail, forcing application developers to create their own coding schemes for systems. Some of these schemes have been put forward as possible standards, but they have not been widely accepted. This paper reviews existing schemes used for abstracting, electronic record systems, and comprehensive coding. It also discusses the remaining impediments to acceptance of standards and the current efforts to overcome them, including SNOMED, the Gabrieli Medical Nomenclature, the Read Clinical Codes, GALEN, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69dc3c70d99c084fa0557f226e38db556abbe0bf,69dc3c70d99c084fa0557f226e38db556abbe0bf
Review Paper : Psychology of the Scientist: An Evaluative Review,M. Mahoney,"Although the social processes in scientific inquiry have received extensive analysis, psychologists have devoted relatively little attention to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the individual scientist. This neglect has resulted in an unfortunate failure to evaluate long held assumptions about scientist behaviour. This article reviews sociological, archival, and recent experimental evidence bearing on the psychology of the scientist. These data suggest that the correspondence between scientist behaviour and accepted scientific 'ideals' may be far less than has been presumed. After briefly reappraising those ideals, it is argued that psychological research - and particularly psychological theorizing- are critical to an adequate understanding and refinement of human factors in science.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/330003d3f0930e33a11ac3ed6decdb0ea421faf2,330003d3f0930e33a11ac3ed6decdb0ea421faf2

Developing rigor in qualitative research: problems and opportunities within sport and exercise psychology,"Brett Smith, Kerry R. McGannon","ABSTRACT Qualitative research has grown within sport and exercise psychology and is now widely conducted. The purpose of this review is to discuss three commonly used ways to demonstrate rigor when conducting or judging qualitative research in sport and exercise psychology. These are the method of member checking, the method of inter-rater reliability, and the notion of universal criteria. Problems with each method are first highlighted. Member checking and inter-rater reliability are shown to be ineffective for verification, trustworthiness, or reliability purposes. Next, universal criteria within the context of Tracy’s, heavily drawn on paper within sport and exercise psychology is problematized. Throughout the discussion of each method and universal criteria more suitable possibilities for conducting rigorous qualitative research are offered. The paper concludes that to support high-quality qualitative research, scholars – including journal editors and reviewers – need to change how rigor is developed and judged, rather than perpetuate the problems with how it has been commonly evaluated in the past. Recommendations for developing rigor when conducting and/or judging qualitative research within sport and exercise psychology are also offered.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/950373d3f41bc76688fa386d3c08483b61e06ef2,950373d3f41bc76688fa386d3c08483b61e06ef2

Healthcare is one industry in which blockchain is expected to have significant impacts. Research in this area is relatively new but growing rapidly; so, health informatics researchers and practitioners are always struggling to keep pace with research progress in this area. This paper reports on a systematic review of the ongoing research in the application of blockchain technology in healthcare. The research methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and a systematic mapping study process, in which a well-designed search protocol is used to search four scientific databases, to identify, extract and analyze all relevant publications. The review shows that a number of studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in healthcare; however, there is a lack of adequate prototype implementations and studies to characterize the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. The review further highlights the state-of-the-art in the development of blockchain applications for healthcare, their limitations and the areas for future research.

Data Sources Scoping reviews that exemplify best practice are explored with reference to the recently updated JBI scoping review guide (2020) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses Scoping Review extension (PRISMA‐ScR). Implications for nursing and midwifery Scoping reviews are an increasingly common form of evidence synthesis. They are used to address broad research questions and to map evidence from a variety of sources. Scoping reviews are a useful form of evidence synthesis for those in nursing and midwifery and present opportunities for researchers to review a broad array of evidence and resources. However, scoping reviews still need to be conducted with rigour and transparency. Conclusion This study provides guidance and advice for researchers and clinicians who are preparing to undertake an evidence synthesis and are considering a scoping review methodology in the field of nursing and midwifery. Impact With the increasing popularity of scoping reviews, criticism of the rigour, transparency, and appropriateness of the methodology have been raised across multiple academic and clinical disciplines, including nursing and midwifery.

Contact between children in out‐of‐home placements and their family and friends networks: a research review,"R. Sen, K. Broadhurst","This paper provides a detailed narrative review of the current knowledge base regarding family contact for children in out-of-home foster, kinship and residential placements. The review considers the research base around the familiar topics of the relationship between contact and outcomes for children, the perspectives of children, parents and carers in respect of contact and contact between siblings. It also discusses research evidence around emerging, and less well-recognized themes which include the impact of intensive contact on infants, re-establishing contact between children and birth parents when it has been lost, contact between children, their extended family and ‘significant others’, and the role of technology in family contact. In providing an overview of key research, the review concludes that good quality contact with family members in conjunction with other positive professional interventions, will likely promote positive outcomes for children regarding successful family reunification and/or placement stability. Social workers' central role in influencing the pattern and quality of contact for children is underlined. However, the review cautions against making broad prescriptions for all children, given that poorly planned, poor quality and unsupported contact may be harmful.

Multilevel Inverter Topologies With Reduced Device Count: A Review,"K. Gupta, A. Ranjan, P. Bhatnagar, Lalit Kumar Sahu, Shailendra Jain","Multilevel inverters have created a new wave of interest in industry and research. While the classical topologies have proved to be a viable alternative in a wide range of high-power medium-voltage applications, there has been an active interest in the evolution of newer topologies. Reduction in overall part count as compared to the classical topologies has been an important objective in the recently introduced topologies. In this paper, some of the recently proposed multilevel inverter topologies with reduced power switch count are reviewed and analyzed. The paper will serve as an introduction and an update to these topologies, both in terms of the qualitative and quantitative parameters. Also, it takes into account the challenges which arise when an attempt is made to reduce the device count. Based on a detailed comparison of these topologies as presented in this paper, appropriate multilevel solution can be arrived at for a given application.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05a958194f1756fb91ddd3e2cd5794f9b0c312ce,05a958194f1756fb91ddd3e2cd5794f9b0c312ce
Research in urban logistics: a systematic literature review,"A. Lagorio, R. Pinto, Ruggero Golini","Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The last decades have witnessed an increased interest in urban logistics originating from both the research and the practitioners’ communities. Sustainable freight transports today are on the political, social and technological agenda of many actors operating in urban contexts. Due to the extent of the covered areas and the continuous progress in many fields, the resulting body of research on urban logistics appears quite fragmented. From an engineering management perspective, the purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review (SLR) that aims to consolidate the knowledge on urban logistics, analyse the development of the discipline, and provide future research directions. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The paper discusses the main evidence emerging from a SLR on urban logistics. The corpus resulting from the SLR has been used to perform a citation network analysis and a main path analysis that together underpin the identification of the most investigated topics and methodologies in the field. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Through the analysis of a corpus of 104 articles, the most important research contributions on urban logistics that represent the structural backbone in the development of the research over time in the field are detected.

"Internal crowdsourcing: conceptual framework, structured review, and research agenda","Oliver Zuchowski, Oliver Posegga, D. Schlagwein, K. Fischbach","The use of IT-enabled crowdsourcing with employees in enterprises has increased substantially in recent years. This phenomenon, which we refer to as ‘internal crowdsourcing’, is distinct both from external crowdsourcing with end users and from hierarchy-based work with employees. A literature stream has emerged that corresponds with the increased relevance of internal crowdsourcing in practice. The purpose of this review paper of internal crowdsourcing is to provide conceptual development, synthesise the literature, and provide a research agenda. In the review reported in this paper, we systematically analysed and critically reviewed the literature in this domain published thus far (74 papers). We found useful findings and insights into a new and relevant IT-enabled phenomenon. At the same time, we also found conflicting definitions and conceptualisation, as well as research efforts that are not well integrated.

Review of empirical research on intellectual capital and firm performance,Henri Inkinen,"Purpose – The basis of value creation has shifted from tangible factors of production towards intangible resources such as intellectual capital (IC) (e.g. Grant, 1996). The average organisation’s IC has been estimated to be three to four times over its book value (Edvinsson and Malone, 1997); thus, it is vital for companies to understand how it is created, managed, measured and evaluated. However, there are still many debated and complex issues, and the empirical measurement of IC is one of those. The purpose of this paper is to determine if IC systematically influences firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic review procedure was utilised as this study’s research design. Findings – The findings demonstrate that IC influences firm performance mainly through interactions, combinations and mediations. Also, there is a great deal of evidence on the significant relationship between IC and firm’s innovation performance.

Carlsen","BackgroundThe GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach has been developed by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working Group. The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision making, including guideline development and policy formulation.CERQual includes four components for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from reviews of qualitative research (also referred to as qualitative evidence syntheses): (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data and (4) relevance. This paper is part of a series providing guidance on how to apply CERQual and focuses on making an overall assessment of confidence in a review finding and creating a CERQual Evidence Profile and a CERQual Summary of Qualitative Findings table.MethodsWe developed this guidance by examining the methods used by other GRADE approaches, gathering feedback from relevant research communities and developing consensus through project group meetings. We then piloted the guidance on several qualitative evidence syntheses before agreeing on the approach.ResultsConfidence in the evidence is an assessment of the extent to which a review finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. Creating a summary of each review finding and deciding whether or not CERQual should be used are important steps prior to assessing confidence. Confidence should be assessed for each review finding individually, based on the judgements made for each of the four CERQual components. Four levels are used to describe the overall assessment of confidence: high, moderate, low or very low. The overall CERQual assessment for each review finding should be explained in a CERQual Evidence Profile and Summary of Qualitative Findings table.ConclusionsStructuring and summarising review findings, assessing confidence in those findings using CERQual and creating a CERQual Evidence Profile and Summary of Qualitative Findings table should be essential components of undertaking qualitative evidence syntheses. This paper describes the end point of a CERQual assessment and should be read in conjunction with the other papers in the series that provide information on assessing individual CERQual components.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3d604fb973c32602b77a447643e5ede5b420f9a,d3d604fb973c32602b77a447643e5ede5b420f9a
Research Paper: Identifying Adverse Drug Events: Development of a Computer-based Monitor and Comparison with Chart Review and Stimulated Voluntary Report,"A. Jha, G. Kuperman, J. Teich, L. Leape, Brian Shea, E. Rittenberg, E. Burdick, D. Seger, M. V. Vliet, D. Bates","BACKGROUND
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are both common and costly. Most hospitals identify ADEs using spontaneous reporting, but this approach lacks sensitivity; chart review identifies more events but is expensive. Computer-based approaches to ADE identification appear promising, but they have not been directly compared with chart review and they are not widely used.


OBJECTIVES
To develop a computer-based ADE monitor, and to compare the rate and type of ADEs found with the monitor with those discovered by chart review and by stimulated voluntary report.


DESIGN
Prospective cohort study in one tertiary-care hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
All patients admitted to nine medical and surgical units in a tertiary-care hospital over an eight-month period.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Adverse drug events identified by the computer-based monitor, by chart review, and by stimulated voluntary report.


METHODS
A computer-based monitoring program identified alerts, which were situations suggesting that an ADE might be present (e.g., an order for an antidote such as naloxone). A trained reviewer then examined patients' hospital records to determine whether an ADE had occurred. The results of the computer-based monitoring strategy were compared with two other ADE detection strategies: intensive chart review and stimulated voluntary report by nurses and pharmacists. The monitor and the chart review strategies were independent, and the reviewers were blinded.


RESULTS
The computer monitoring strategy identified 2,620 alerts, of which 275 were determined to be ADEs. The chart review found 398 ADEs, whereas voluntary report detected 23. Of the 617 ADEs detected by at least one method, 76 ADEs were detected by both computer monitor and chart review. The computer monitor identified 45 percent; chart review, 65 percent; and voluntary report, 4 percent. The ADEs identified by computer monitor were more likely to be classified as ""severe"" than were those identified by chart review (51 versus 42 percent, p = .04). The positive predictive value of computer-generated alerts was 16 percent during the first eight weeks of the study; rule modifications increased this to 23 percent in the final eight weeks. The computer strategy required 11 person-hours per week to execute, whereas chart review required 55 person-hours per week and voluntary report strategy required 5.


CONCLUSIONS
The computer-based monitor identified fewer ADEs than did chart review but many more ADEs than did stimulated voluntary report. The overlap among the ADEs identified using different methods was small, suggesting that the incidence of ADEs may be higher than previously reported and that different detection methods capture different events. The computer-based monitoring system represents an efficient approach for measuring ADE frequency and gauging the effectiveness of ADE prevention programs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a60e9424dbdfbd86b80d60578ad87243a6d87ec3,a60e9424dbdfbd86b80d60578ad87243a6d87ec3
Digital Transformation: An Overview of the Current State of the Art of Research,"S. Kraus, Paul Jones, Norbert Kailer, Alexandra Weinmann, Nuria Chaparro‐Banegas, N. Roig-Tierno","The increasing digitalization of economies has highlighted the importance of digital transformation and how it can help businesses stay competitive in the market. However, disruptive changes not only occur at the company level; they also have environmental, societal, and institutional implications. This is the reason why during the past two decades the research on digital transformation has received growing attention, with a wide range of topics investigated in the literature. The following aims to provide insight regarding the current state of the literature on digital transformation (DT) by conducting a systematic literature review. An analysis of co-occurrence using the software VOSviewer was conducted to graphically visualize the literature’s node network. Approached this way, the systematic literature review displays major research avenues of digital transformation that consider technology as the main driver of these changes. This paper qualitatively classifies the literature on digital business transformation into three different clusters based on technological, business, and societal impacts. Several research gaps identified in the literature on DT are proposed as futures lines of research which could provide useful insights to the government and private sectors in order to adapt to the disruptive changes found in business as a result of this phenomenon, as well as to reduce its negative impacts on society and the environment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e8e03b26c29b6b83508b08def7e3882798afca46,e8e03b26c29b6b83508b08def7e3882798afca46
What kind of systematic review should I conduct? A proposed typology and guidance for systematic reviewers in the medical and health sciences,"Z. Munn, Cindy Stern, E. Aromataris, C. Lockwood, Z. Jordan","BackgroundSystematic reviews have been considered as the pillar on which evidence-based healthcare rests. Systematic review methodology has evolved and been modified over the years to accommodate the range of questions that may arise in the health and medical sciences. This paper explores a concept still rarely considered by novice authors and in the literature: determining the type of systematic review to undertake based on a research question or priority.ResultsWithin the framework of the evidence-based healthcare paradigm, defining the question and type of systematic review to conduct is a pivotal first step that will guide the rest of the process and has the potential to impact on other aspects of the evidence-based healthcare cycle (evidence generation, transfer and implementation). It is something that novice reviewers (and others not familiar with the range of review types available) need to take account of but frequently overlook. Our aim is to provide a typology of review types and describe key elements that need to be addressed during question development for each type.ConclusionsIn this paper a typology is proposed of various systematic review methodologies. The review types are defined and situated with regard to establishing corresponding questions and inclusion criteria. The ultimate objective is to provide clarified guidance for both novice and experienced reviewers and a unified typology with respect to review types.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5927f7bf2725c6a52cba846c61d67f2a66ecdc91,5927f7bf2725c6a52cba846c61d67f2a66ecdc91

Distributed Leadership in Organizations: A Review of Theory and Research,R. Bolden,"The aim of this paper is to review conceptual and empirical literature on the concept of distributed leadership (DL) in order to identify its origins, key arguments, and areas for further work. Consideration is given to the similarities and differences between DL and related concepts including ‘shared’, ‘collective’, ‘collaborative’, ‘emergent’, ‘co-‘ and ‘democratic’ leadership. Findings indicate that whilst there are some common theoretical bases, the relative usage of these concepts varies over time, between countries and between sectors. In particular, DL is a notion that has seen a rapid growth in interest since the year 2000 but research remains largely restricted to the field of school education and of proportionally more interest to UK than US-based academics. Several scholars are increasingly going to lengths to indicate that in order to be ‘distributed’ leadership need not necessarily be widely ‘shared’ or ‘democratic’ and in order to be effective there is a need to balance different ‘hybrid configurations’ of practice. The article highlights a number of areas for further attention, including three factors relating to the context of much work on DL (power and influence; organisational boundaries and context; and ethics and diversity), and three methodological and developmental challenges (ontology; research methods; and leadership development, reward and recognition). It is concluded that descriptive and normative perspectives that dominate the literature should be supplemented by more critical accounts that recognise the rhetorical and discursive significance of DL in (re)constructing leader-follower identities, mobilising collective engagement and challenging or reinforcing traditional forms of organisation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c764ea52745dd30a11271e8954977fecbbc4591,2c764ea52745dd30a11271e8954977fecbbc4591
Scientific Paper Recommendation: A Survey,"Xiaomei Bai, Mengyang Wang, Ivan Lee, Zhuo Yang, Xiangjie Kong, Feng Xia","Globally, the recommendation services have become important due to the fact that they support e-commerce applications and different research communities. Recommender systems have a large number of applications in many fields, including economic, education, and scientific research. Different empirical studies have shown that the recommender systems are more effective and reliable than the keyword-based search engines for extracting useful knowledge from massive amounts of data. The problem of recommending similar scientific articles in scientific community is called scientific paper recommendation. Scientific paper recommendation aims to recommend new articles or classical articles that match researchers’ interests. It has become an attractive area of study since the number of scholarly papers increases exponentially. In this paper, we first introduce the importance and advantages of the paper recommender systems. Second, we review the recommendation algorithms and methods, such as Content-based, collaborative filtering, graph-based, and hybrid methods. Then, we introduce the evaluation methods of different recommender systems.

A Review of False Data Injection Attacks Against Modern Power Systems,"Gaoqi Liang, Junhua Zhao, Fengji Luo, S. Weller, Z. Dong","With rapid advances in sensor, computer, and communication networks, modern power systems have become complicated cyber-physical systems. Assessing and enhancing cyber-physical system security is, therefore, of utmost importance for the future electricity grid. In a successful false data injection attack (FDIA), an attacker compromises measurements from grid sensors in such a way that undetected errors are introduced into estimates of state variables such as bus voltage angles and magnitudes. In evading detection by commonly employed residue-based bad data detection tests, FDIAs are capable of severely threatening power system security. Since the first published research on FDIAs in 2009, research into FDIA-based cyber-attacks has been extensive. This paper gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art in FDIAs against modern power systems. This paper first summarizes the theoretical basis of FDIAs, and then discusses both the physical and the economic impacts of a successful FDIA.

On the shoulders of giants: undertaking a structured literature review in accounting,"M. Massaro, John Dumay, J. Guthrie","Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to present a method for a structured literature review (SLR). An SLR is a method for examining a corpus of scholarly literature, to develop insights, critical reflections, future research paths and research questions. SLRs are common in scientific disciplines dominated by quantitative approaches, but they can be adapted in accounting studies since quantitative and qualitative approaches are commonly accepted. Design/methodology/approach - – A literature review, as a piece of academic writing, must have a logical, planned structure. The authors also argue it requires tests based on qualitative and quantitative methods. Therefore, the authors describe ten steps for developing an SLR. Findings - – The SLR method is a way that scholars can stand “on the shoulders of giants” and provide insightful and impactful research that is different to the traditional authorship approaches to literature reviews. Research limitations/implications - – Traditional literature reviews can have varied results because of a lack of rigour. SLRs use a process that, through a set of rules, potentially offers less bias and more transparency of the execution and measures and techniques of validation and reliability. Practical implications - – SLRs provide an approach that can help academics to discover under-investigated topics and methods, nurturing, therefore, the development of new knowledge areas and research approaches. Originality/value - – The paper presents accounting researchers with an opportunity to develop insightful and publishable studies, and also serves as a basis for developing future research agendas in the accounting field. The authors advocate the SLR method especially to higher degree research students and emerging scholars as a way of potentially developing robust and defensible research agendas and questions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fba46699b346fc5fc125246e9231163421f0cd4d,fba46699b346fc5fc125246e9231163421f0cd4d

A review of research on augmented reality in education: Advantages and applications,"N. Saidin, Noor Dayana Abd Halim, Noraffandy Yahaya","Technology in education can influence students to learn actively and can motivate them, leading to an effective process of learning. Previous research has identified the problem that technology will create a passive learning process if the technology used does not promote critical thinking, meaning-making or metacognition. Since its introduction, augmented reality (AR) has been shown to have good potential in making the learning process more active, effective and meaningful. This is because its advanced technology enables users to interact with virtual and real-time applications and brings the natural experiences to the user. In addition, the merging of AR with education has recently attracted research attention because of its ability to allow students to be immersed in realistic experiences. Therefore, this concept paper reviews the research that has been conducted on AR. The review describes the application of AR in a number of fields of learning including Medicine, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, Biology, Astronomy and History. This paper also discusses the advantages of AR compared to traditional technology (such as e-learning and courseware) and traditional teaching methods (chalk and talk and traditional books).

"A New Dimension of Health Care: Systematic Review of the Uses, Benefits, and Limitations of Social Media for Health Communication","A. Moorhead, Diane E Hazlett, L. Harrison, J. Carroll, A. Irwin, C. Hoving","Background There is currently a lack of information about the uses, benefits, and limitations of social media for health communication among the general public, patients, and health professionals from primary research. Objective To review the current published literature to identify the uses, benefits, and limitations of social media for health communication among the general public, patients, and health professionals, and identify current gaps in the literature to provide recommendations for future health communication research. Methods This paper is a review using a systematic approach. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using nine electronic databases and manual searches to locate peer-reviewed studies published between January 2002 and February 2012. Results The search identified 98 original research studies that included the uses, benefits, and/or limitations of social media for health communication among the general public, patients, and health professionals. The methodological quality of the studies assessed using the Downs and Black instrument was low; this was mainly due to the fact that the vast majority of the studies in this review included limited methodologies and was mainly exploratory and descriptive in nature. Seven main uses of social media for health communication were identified, including focusing on increasing interactions with others, and facilitating, sharing, and obtaining health messages. The six key overarching benefits were identified as (1) increased interactions with others, (2) more available, shared, and tailored information, (3) increased accessibility and widening access to health information, (4) peer/social/emotional support, (5) public health surveillance, and (6) potential to influence health policy. Twelve limitations were identified, primarily consisting of quality concerns and lack of reliability, confidentiality, and privacy. Conclusions Social media brings a new dimension to health care as it offers a medium to be used by the public, patients, and health professionals to communicate about health issues with the possibility of potentially improving health outcomes. Social media is a powerful tool, which offers collaboration between users and is a social interaction mechanism for a range of individuals. Although there are several benefits to the use of social media for health communication, the information exchanged needs to be monitored for quality and reliability, and the users’ confidentiality and privacy need to be maintained. Eight gaps in the literature and key recommendations for future health communication research were provided. Examples of these recommendations include the need to determine the relative effectiveness of different types of social media for health communication using randomized control trials and to explore potential mechanisms for monitoring and enhancing the quality and reliability of health communication using social media. Further robust and comprehensive evaluation and review, using a range of methodologies, are required to establish whether social media improves health communication practice both in the short and long terms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26be447a6d668aa19f3e550a7ff54103df0d7d54,26be447a6d668aa19f3e550a7ff54103df0d7d54
Literature review on disruption recovery in the supply chain*,"D. Ivanov, A. Dolgui, B. Sokolov, Marina Ivanova","Recent research underlines the crucial role of disruption events and recovery policies in supply chains. Despite a wealth of literature on supply chain design with disruption considerations, to the best of our knowledge there is no survey on supply chain with disruptions and recovery considerations. We analyse state-of-the-art research streams on supply chain design and planning with both disruptions and recovery considerations with the aim of relating the existing quantitative methods to empirical research. The paper structures and classifies existing research streams and application areas of different quantitative methods subject to different disruption risks and recovery measures. We identify gaps in current research and delineate future research avenues. The results of this study are twofold: operations and supply chain managers can observe which quantitative tools are available for different application areas; on the other hand, limitations and future research needs for decision-support methods in supply chain risk management domains can be identified.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eca78c2f21984819b2f19d723543c5d7f25d7e25,eca78c2f21984819b2f19d723543c5d7f25d7e25
"ASSESSING ""NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS"": Social Processes and New Directions in Research","R. Sampson, Jeffrey D. Morenoff, Thomas Gannon-Rowley","▪ Abstract This paper assesses and synthesizes the cumulative results of a new “neighborhood-effects” literature that examines social processes related to problem behaviors and health-related outcomes. Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias.

What Is the Bioeconomy? A Review of the Literature,"Markus M. Bugge, Teis Hansen, Antje Klitkou","The notion of the bioeconomy has gained importance in both research and policy debates over the last decade, and is frequently argued to be a key part of the solution to multiple grand challenges. Despite this, there seems to be little consensus concerning what bioeconomy actually implies. Consequently, this paper seeks to enhance our understanding of what the notion of bioeconomy means by exploring the origins, uptake, and contents of the term “bioeconomy” in the academic literature. Firstly, we perform a bibliometric analysis that highlights that the bioeconomy research community is still rather fragmented and distributed across many different fields of science, even if natural and engineering sciences take up the most central role. Secondly, we carry out a literature review that identifies three visions of the bioeconomy. The bio-technology vision emphasises the importance of bio-technology research and application and commercialisation of bio-technology in different sectors of the economy. The bio-resource vision focuses on processing and upgrading of biological raw materials, as well as on the establishment of new value chains. Finally, the bio-ecology vision highlights sustainability and ecological processes that optimise the use of energy and nutrients, promote biodiversity, and avoid monocultures and soil degradation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b77718cb114f3feedbd8185c0f2286c3888fbfa,8b77718cb114f3feedbd8185c0f2286c3888fbfa
Conducting systematic literature review in operations management,"A. M. T. Thomé, L. F. Scavarda, A. Scavarda","Abstract Systematic literature review (SLR) is a well-known research method. However, there is a paucity of detailed SLR guidelines in operations management (OM). The recent interest in SLR in OM has not been followed by the same rigour observed in disciplines as medical sciences and public policy. There are no OM-specific SLR protocols, detailed step-by-step methods and reporting procedures. Therefore, this paper provides a step-by-step approach to SLR for OM scholars and an overview of SLR’s evolution as a research method in OM and the resulting progression of themes. The step-by-step approach aims to serve as a guideline sufficiently broad to avoid skipping any significant step, but still being easy to be understood and applied. The paper describes procedures for rigourous SLR, reveals a growing use of literature review in OM, specially for qualitative SLR and traditional narrative reviews, assesses contemporary and emerging themes in OM, and provides a research agenda.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8371f27bf671f1fe2027290f2b362263f009264a,8371f27bf671f1fe2027290f2b362263f009264a

Ten years on: A review of recent research on the Job Demand–Control (-Support) model and psychological well-being,"J. Häusser, A. Mojzisch, Miriam Niesel, S. Schulz-Hardt","Abstract In 1999, van der Doef and Maes published a systematic review focusing on the Job-Demand–Control (JDC) model (Karasek, 1979) and the Job Demand–Control (-Support) (JDCS) model (Johnson & Hall, 1988) in relation to psychological well-being. Their review covered the period from 1979 to 1997. The present paper updates and extends this review. Covering research from 83 studies published between 1998 and 2007, our review revealed three major results: First, support for additive effects of demands, control, and social support on general psychological well-being is almost always found if the sample size is sufficient. Second, although there was consistent evidence for additive effects in relation to job-related well-being in cross-sectional studies, support rates were lower in longitudinal data. Thus, reciprocal or reversed causation might account for part of the association between JDC/JDCS dimensions and job-related well-being. Finally, evidence for interactive effects as predicted by the buffer hypotheses of the JDC/JDCS model was very weak overall. However, the pattern of results indicates that this is due neither to spurious evidence for such interactions nor to small effect sizes. Instead, our results suggest that buffering effects depend on whether or not demands and control are based on qualitatively identical JDC/JDCS dimensions (matching principle).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6624dd6cffb589de86bf6c5dea52d24cebbd4a8,a6624dd6cffb589de86bf6c5dea52d24cebbd4a8
Realist review - a new method of systematic review designed for complex policy interventions,"R. Pawson, T. Greenhalgh, G. Harvey, K. Walshe","Evidence-based policy is a dominant theme in contemporary public services but the practical realities and challenges involved in using evidence in policy-making are formidable. Part of the problem is one of complexity. In health services and other public services, we are dealing with complex social interventions which act on complex social systems-things like league tables, performance measures, regulation and inspection, or funding reforms. These are not ‘magic bullets‘ which will always hit their target, but programmes whose effects are crucially dependent on context and implementation. Traditional methods of review focus on measuring and reporting on programme effectiveness, often find that the evidence is mixed or conflicting, and provide little or no clue as to why the intervention worked or did not work when applied in different contexts or circumstances, deployed by different stakeholders, or used for different purposes. This paper offers a model of research synthesis which is designed to work with complex social interventions or programmes, and which is based on the emerging ‘realist’ approach to evaluation. It provides an explanatory analysis aimed at discerning what works for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how. The first step is to make explicit the programme theory (or theories) - the underlying assumptions about how an intervention is meant to work and what impacts it is expected to have. We then look for empirical evidence to populate this theoretical framework, supporting, contradicting or modifying the programme theories as it goes. The results of the review combine theoretical understanding and empirical evidence, and focus on explaining the relationship between the context in which the intervention is applied, the mechanisms by which it works and the outcomes which are produced. The aim is to enable decision-makers to reach a deeper understanding of the intervention and how it can be made to work most effectively. Realist review does not provide simple answers to complex questions. It will not tell policy-makers or managers whether something works or not, but will provide the policy and practice community with the kind of rich, detailed and highly practical understanding of complex social interventions which is likely to be of much more use to them when planning and implementing programmes at a national, regional or local level.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0da66f6f31d499a5b0d1cfa2a76b1c1d95e50bc3,0da66f6f31d499a5b0d1cfa2a76b1c1d95e50bc3

"Psychological resilience: A review and critique of definitions, concepts, and theory.","D. Fletcher, Mustafa Sarkar","The purpose of this paper is to review and critique the variety of definitions, concepts, and theories of psychological resilience. To this end, the narrative is divided into three main sections. The first considers how resilience has been defined in the psychology research literature. Despite the construct being operationalized in a variety of ways, most definitions are based around two core concepts: adversity and positive adaptation. A substantial body of evidence suggests that resilience is required in response to different adversities, ranging from ongoing daily hassles to major life events, and that positive adaptation must be conceptually appropriate to the adversity examined in terms of the domains assessed and the stringency of criteria used. The second section examines the conceptualization of resilience as either a trait or a process, and explores how it is distinct from a number of related terms. Resilience is conceptualized as the interactive influence of psychological characteristics within the context of the stress process. The final section reviews the theories of resilience and critically examines one theory in particular that is commonly cited in the resilience literature. Future theories in this area should take into account the multiple demands individuals encounter, the meta-cognitive and -emotive processes that affect the resilience-stress relationship, and the conceptual distinction between resilience and coping. The review concludes with implications for policy, practice, and research including the need to carefully manage individuals’ immediate environment, and to develop the protective and promotive factors that individuals can proactively use to build resilience.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f452ce8e77c34d534b780423f0cc47ad8bee23be,f452ce8e77c34d534b780423f0cc47ad8bee23be

Fear and Entrepreneurship: A Review and Research Agenda,"G. Cacciotti, J. Hayton","A systematic review of the entrepreneurship literature on fear published up to 2014 highlights several key characteristics. First, the predominant focus in research examining the emotion of fear in entrepreneurship is on the specific concept of fear of failure. However, this literature shows a lack of precision in the conceptualization and operationalization of this construct. The impact of the experience of fear on individual cognition and behaviour can be beneficial as well as detrimental. Despite this dualistic nature, to date, fear is examined as only a barrier to entrepreneurial behaviour. This review reveals a clear dichotomy in the literature, with significantly more focus on fear as a trait that distinguishes between people than as a temporary state that is commonly experienced by many people. Defining fear of failure as a context-specific phenomenon, this paper explains the importance of focusing on the temporary cognitive and emotional experience of fear and use conceptual observations as a platform to develop an agenda for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d7a8be893bc2cd61ff4cf363ce790f9332d01dd3,d7a8be893bc2cd61ff4cf363ce790f9332d01dd3

Snowball Sampling: A Purposeful Method of Sampling in Qualitative Research,"M. Naderifar, H. Goli, Fereshteh Ghaljaie","Background and Objectives: Snowball sampling is applied when samples with the target characteristics are not easily accessible. 
This research describes snowball sampling as a purposeful method of data collection in qualitative research. 
Methods: This paper is a descriptive review of previous research papers. Data were gathered using English keywords, including “review,” 
“declaration,” “snowball,” and “chain referral,” as well as Persian keywords that are equivalents of the following: “purposeful 
sampling,” “snowball,” “qualitative research,” and “descriptive review.” The databases included Google Scholar, Scopus, Irandoc, ProQuest, 
Science Direct, SID, MagIran, Medline, and Cochrane. The search was limited to Persian and English articles written between 
2005 and 2013. 
Results: The preliminary search yielded 433 articles from PubMed, 88 articles from Scopus, 1 article from SID, and 18 articles from 
MagIran. Among 125 articles, methodological and non-research articles were omitted. Finally, 11 relevant articles, which met the 
criteria, were selected for review. 
Conclusions: Different methods of snowball sampling can be applied to facilitate scientific research, provide community-based 
data, and hold health educational programs. Snowball sampling can be effectively used to analyze vulnerable groups or individuals 
under special care. In fact, it allows researchers to access susceptible populations. Thus, it is suggested to consider snowball 
sampling strategies while working with the attendees of educational programs or samples of research studies.

A summary review of vibration-based damage identification methods,"S. Doebling, C. Farrar, M. Prime","This paper provides an overview of methods to detect, locate, and characterize damage in structural and mechanical systems by examining changes in measured vibration response. Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa37144cd561872b18846701bfcff55b10e3ca0f,aa37144cd561872b18846701bfcff55b10e3ca0f

This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations.MethodsEight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties.ResultsNineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable.ConclusionWe found no current 'gold standard' amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work.

We propose that social enterprises that combine the organizational forms of both business and charity at their cores are an ideal type of hybrid organization, making social enterprise an attractive setting to study hybrid organizing.

ERM proposes the integrated management of all the risks an organization faces, which inherently requires alignment of risk management with corporate governance and strategy. Academic research on ERM is still in its infancy with articles largely in accounting and finance journals, but rarely in management journals. We argue that ERM offers an important new domain of research for management scholars. A critical review of ERM research allows us to identify limitations and gaps that management scholars are best equipped to address.

Cellulose nanofibrils: Challenges and possibilities as a paper additive or coating material – A review,"F. W. Brodin, Ø. Gregersen, K. Syverud","Today, there is widespread scientific and commercial interest in cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). The exploration of new manufacturing methods and pretreatments has enabled a less energy intensive production of CNF. In this review the use of CNF in paper making applications as a paper additive or coating material have been summarized and discussed. CNF can be added directly into the pulp furnish, and by using a relatively low amount of CNF together with suitable retention aids potential problems related to dewatering can be avoided. This type of CNF addition enables either decreased basis weight or increased filler content with maintained paper strength. CNF can also be applied in coating formulations. Increased surface smoothness and enhanced barrier properties are key benefits obtained by CNF containing coatings, but challenges exist such as the high water content of CNF coatings and the low moisture resistance of CNF barriers.

Meta-synthesis method for qualitative research: a literature review.,"D. Walsh, S. Downe","AIM
This paper discusses the purpose and stages of meta-synthesis and the epistemological status of knowledge generated from the technique. Particular attention is paid to exploring the contested areas of the method that remain.


BACKGROUND
There is a growing interest in meta-synthesis as a technique for generating new insights and understanding from qualitative health care research. An increasing number of meta-synthesis papers are appearing in the nursing and midwifery literature.


METHODS
Literature on the technique of meta-synthesis and examples of meta-synthesis papers were searched and reviewed. A meta-synthesis exercise was undertaken, and this informed reflection and critique of the method.


FINDINGS
Meta-synthesis attempts to integrate results from a number of different but inter-related qualitative studies. The technique has an interpretive, rather than aggregating, intent, in contrast to meta-analysis of quantitative studies. Examples from the literature indicate that some aspects of the technique are not yet fully established.


CONCLUSION
Despite the contingent nature of evidence gleaned from meta-synthesis and current lack of consensus about some of its aspects, meta-synthesis is an important technique for qualitative researchers and can deepen understanding of the contextual dimensions of health care.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4dc2a922b783dc7a090bad91c8c1f1b7799d223a,4dc2a922b783dc7a090bad91c8c1f1b7799d223a
Thirty Years of Prospect Theory in Economics: A Review and Assessment,N. Barberis,"Prospect theory, first described in a 1979 paper by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, is widely viewed as the best available description of how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. While the theory contains many remarkable insights, it has proven challenging to apply these insights in economic settings, and it is only recently that there has been real progress in doing so. In this paper, after first reviewing prospect theory and the difficulties inherent in applying it, I discuss some of this recent work. It is too early to declare this research effort an unqualified success. But the rapid progress of the last decade makes me optimistic that at least some of the insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6284eb72dab755f90364d93416e69471595a6271,6284eb72dab755f90364d93416e69471595a6271
User Involvement and MIS Success: A Review of Research,"B. Ives, Margrethe H. Olson","User involvement in the design of computer-based information systems is enthusiastically endorsed in the prescriptive literature. However determining when and how much, or even if, user involvement is appropriate are questions that have received inadequate research attention. In this paper research that examines the link between user involvement and indicators of system success is reviewed. The authors find that much of the existing research is poorly grounded in theory and methodologically flawed; as a result, the benefits of user involvement have not been convincingly demonstrated. Until higher quality studies are completed intuition, experience, and unsubstantiated prescriptions will remain the practitioner's best guide to the determination of appropriate levels and types of user involvement; these will generally suggest that user involvement is appropriate for unstructured problems or when user acceptance is important. 
 
In order to foster higher quality integrated research and to increase understanding of the user involvement-system success relationship, the authors present the following: a conceptual framework into which previous research has been mapped that can provide direction to future efforts; a review of existing measures of user involvement and system success; a set of variables that have been proposed as potentially impacting the relationship between user involvement and system success.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/854a121945013a4f7dbe70aad11d958f635b81a6,854a121945013a4f7dbe70aad11d958f635b81a6
AUV Navigation and Localization: A Review,"L. Paull, Sajad Saeedi, M. Seto, Howard Li","Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods.

First, I provide a brief historical background to set the stage. Then I review research on R/S and mental health, examining relationships with both positive and negative mental health outcomes, where positive outcomes include well-being, happiness, hope, optimism, and gratefulness, and negative outcomes involve depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, delinquency/crime, marital instability, and personality traits (positive and negative). I then explain how and why R/S might influence mental health. Next, I review research on R/S and health behaviors such as physical activity, cigarette smoking, diet, and sexual practices, followed by a review of relationships between R/S and heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, immune functions, endocrine functions, cancer, overall mortality, physical disability, pain, and somatic symptoms.

"Translation, adaptation and validation of instruments or scales for use in cross-cultural health care research: a clear and user-friendly guideline.","V. Sousa, W. Rojjanasrirat","RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The diversity of the population worldwide suggests a great need for cross-culturally validated research instruments or scales. Researchers and clinicians must have access to reliable and valid measures of concepts of interest in their own cultures and languages to conduct cross-cultural research and/or provide quality patient care. Although there are well-established methodological approaches for translating, adapting and validating instruments or scales for use in cross-cultural health care research, a great variation in the use of these approaches continues to prevail in the health care literature. Therefore, the objectives of this scholarly paper were to review published recommendations of cross-cultural validation of instruments and scales, and to propose and present a clear and user-friendly guideline for the translation, adaptation and validation of instruments or scales for cross-cultural health care research.


METHODS
A review of highly recommended methodological approaches to translation, adaptation and cross-cultural validation of research instruments or scales was performed. Recommendations were summarized and incorporated into a seven-step guideline. Each one of the steps was described and key points were highlighted. Example of a project using the proposed steps of the guideline was fully described.


CONCLUSIONS
Translation, adaptation and validation of instruments or scales for cross-cultural research is very time-consuming and requires careful planning and the adoption of rigorous methodological approaches to derive a reliable and valid measure of the concept of interest in the target population.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67373fc529c058c5a469341baa0eeecb4cd37967,67373fc529c058c5a469341baa0eeecb4cd37967

Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Electrical Motors&#8212;A Review,"S. Nandi, H. Toliyat, Xiaodong Li","Recently, research has picked up a fervent pace in the area of fault diagnosis of electrical machines. The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other signals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place.

HVDC Circuit Breakers: A Review Identifying Future Research Needs,Christian M. Franck,"The continuously increasing demand for electric power and the economic access to remote renewable energy sources such as off-shore wind power or solar thermal generation in deserts have revived the interest in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) multiterminal systems (networks). A lot of work was done in this area, especially in the 1980s, but only two three-terminal systems were realized. Since then, HVDC technology has advanced considerably and, despite numerous technical challenges, the realization of large-scale HVDC networks is now seriously discussed and considered. For the acceptance and reliability of these networks, the availability of HVDC circuit breakers (CBs) will be critical, making them one of the key enabling technologies. Numerous ideas for HVDC breaker schemes have been published and patented, but no acceptable solution has been found to interrupt HVDC short-circuit currents. This paper aims to summarize the literature, especially that of the last two decades, on technology areas that are relevant to HVDC breakers. By comparing the mainly 20+ years old, state-of-the art HVDC CBs to the new HVDC technology, existing discrepancies become evident.

Design and Kinematic Modeling of Constant Curvature Continuum Robots: A Review,"R. Webster, Bryan A. Jones","Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot’s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0dfe127a576737d3e28313defaccf763fca18b4,f0dfe127a576737d3e28313defaccf763fca18b4

Teachers' attitudes towards integration / inclusion: a review of the literature,"E. Avramidis, B. Norwich","On the assumption that the successful implementation of any inclusive policy is largely dependent on educators being positive about it, a great deal of research has sought to examine teachers' attitudes towards the integration and, more recently, the inclusion of children with special educational needs in the mainstream school. This paper reviews this large body of research and, in so doing, explores a host of factors that might impact upon teacher acceptance of the inclusion principle. The analyses showed evidence of positive attitudes, but no evidence of acceptance of a total inclusion or ‘zero reject’ approach to special educational provision. Teachers' attitudes were found to be strongly influenced by the nature and severity of the disabling condition presented to them (child-related variables) and less by teacher-related variables.

Load Modeling—A Review,"Anmar I. Arif, Zhaoyu Wang, Jianhui Wang, B. Mather, Hugo Bashualdo, Dongbo Zhao","Load modeling has significant impact on power system studies. This paper presents a review on load modeling and identification techniques. Load models can be classified into two broad categories: 1) static and 2) dynamic models, while there are two types of approaches to identify model parameters: 1) measurement-based and 2) component-based. Load modeling has received more attention in recent years because of the renewable integration, demand-side management, and smart metering devices. However, the commonly used load models are outdated, and cannot represent emerging loads. There is a need to systematically review existing load modeling techniques and suggest future research directions to meet the increasing interests from industry and academia. In this paper, we provide a thorough survey on the academic research progress and industry practices, and highlight existing issues and new trends in load modeling.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/461c6fd06908b4c3a2b654f21cedab0c7baa780e,461c6fd06908b4c3a2b654f21cedab0c7baa780e

What is resilience? A review and concept analysis,G. Windle,"The complexities of defining what appears to be the relatively simple concept of resilience are widely recognized. This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clarifies a definition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identification of the antecedents, defining attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is defined as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‘bouncing back’ in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/520183eefb37770d6249ca717e53d90b6e0059b0,520183eefb37770d6249ca717e53d90b6e0059b0

The Persuasiveness of Source Credibility: A Critical Review of Five Decades' Evidence,Chanthika Pornpitakpan,"This paper reviews the empirical evidence of the effect of credibility of the message source on persuasion over a span of 5 decades, primarily to come up with recommendations for practitioners as to when to use a high- or a low-credibility source and secondarily to identify areas for future research. The main effect studies of source credibility on persuasion seem to indicate the superiority of a high-credibility source over a low-credibility one. Interaction effect studies, however, show source credibility to be a liability under certain conditions.

Modified TiO2 For Environmental Photocatalytic Applications: A Review,"Rimeh Daghrir, P. Drogui, D. Robert","This paper summarizes recent research dealing with development of titanium dioxide (TiO2) used for environmental applications. TiO2 plays the most important role owing to its excellent chemical and physical properties. However, the TiO2 band edge lies in the UV region that makes them inactive under visible irradiation. In this regard, considerable efforts have been made to increase the visible light activity of TiO2 via the modification of its electronic and optical properties. Doping TiO2 using either anions or cations is one of the typical approaches that has been largely applied. Coupling TiO2 with a narrow bad gap semiconductor (MxOy/TiO2 or MxSy/TiO2) represents another approach. This work aims to encompass the new progress of TiO2 for an efficient application in water and wastewater treatment under visible light, emphasizes the future trends of TiO2 in the environment, and suggests new research directions, including preparation aspects for the development of this promising material.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73309df7a165f28982106c936d2df16b50e4c539,73309df7a165f28982106c936d2df16b50e4c539

Networking and Innovation: A Systematic Review of the Evidence,"Luke Pittaway, M. Robertson, Kamal Munir, D. Denyer, Andy Neely","Recent work on competitiveness has emphasized the importance of business networking for innovativeness. Until recently, insights into the dynamics of this relationship have been fragmented. This paper presents a systematic review of research linking the networking behaviour of firms with their innovative capacity. We find that the principal benefits of networking as identified in the literature include: risk sharing; obtaining access to new markets and technologies; speeding products to market; pooling complementary skills; safeguarding property rights when complete or contingent contracts are not possible; and acting as a key vehicle for obtaining access to external knowledge. The evidence also illustrates that those firms which do not co-operate and which do not formally or informally exchange knowledge limit their knowledge base long term and ultimately reduce their ability to enter into exchange relationships. At an institutional level, national systems of innovation play an important role in the diffusion of innovations in terms of the way in which they shape networking activity. The paper provides evidence suggesting that network relationships with suppliers, customers and intermediaries such as professional and trade associations are important factors affecting innovation performance and productivity. Where networks fail, it is due to inter-firm conflict, displacement, lack of scale, external disruption and lack of infrastructure. The review identifies several gaps in the literature that need to be filled. For instance, there is a need for further exploration of the relationship between networking and different forms of innovation, such as process and organisational innovation. Similarly, we need better understanding of network dynamics and network configurations, as well as the role of third parties such as professional and trade associations. Our study highlights the need for interdisciplinary research in these areas.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7ab0729114f2ded195e61f2b15ffee5d6d98bb6,a7ab0729114f2ded195e61f2b15ffee5d6d98bb6

Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Challenges and Recommendations of Literature Search in Information Systems Research,"J. Brocke, Alexander Simons, K. Riemer, Björn Niehaves, Ralf Plattfaut, Anne Cleven","The “standing on the shoulders of giants” metaphor is often used to acknowledge the work of others when undertaking research and, in particular, stresses the importance of literature reviews in scientific inquiry. Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them.

With the improvement of image processing tools and the flexibility of digital image editing, automatic image inpainting has found important applications in computer vision and has also become an important and challenging topic of research in image processing. This paper reviews the existing image inpainting approaches, that were classified into three subcategories, sequential-based, CNN-based, and GAN-based methods. In addition, for each category, a list of methods for different types of distortion on images are presented. Furthermore, the paper also presents available datasets. Last but not least, we present the results of real evaluations of the three categories of image inpainting methods performed on the used datasets, for different types of image distortion. We also present the evaluations metrics and discuss the performance of these methods in terms of these metrics. This overview can be used as a reference for image inpainting researchers, and it can also facilitate the comparison of the methods as well as the datasets used.

An introduction to Docker for reproducible research,C. Boettiger,"As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0b34f80227e9c060bc9c37692278e7cefaa9540,e0b34f80227e9c060bc9c37692278e7cefaa9540
A Review of Wetland Remote Sensing,"M. Guo, Jing Li, C. Sheng, Jiawei Xu, Li Wu","Wetlands are some of the most important ecosystems on Earth. They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification.

Mechanisms for Managing Ambidexterity: A Review and Research Agenda,"N. Turner, J. Swart, H. Maylor","Ambidexterity is of central importance to the competitive advantage of the firm, yet to date there is limited understanding of how it is managed. The theorization of ambidexterity is inadequate for complex, practical realities and, in turn, this hinders the way in which it can aid the management of ambidexterity in practice. This paper asks: What are the mechanisms for achieving ambidexterity? The authors use a systematic review to develop a research framework which integrates intellectual capital resources (organizational, social and human capital) across various levels of analysis (organization, group and individual).

Virtual reality in tourism: a state-of-the-art review,"Julia Beck, M. Rainoldi, R. Egger","
Purpose
Emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), have been influencing both the tourism supply side and tourists alike. The purpose of this study is to analyse VR research in tourism and to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review. As the technological connotation of the term VR has been changing and encompasses various VR systems with different capabilities, this paper aims to provide a systematic and structured overview. The overall objective of this paper is to contribute to a thorough understanding of VR research in tourism.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper comprehensively reviews and analyses existing literature on VR in tourism, published from 1994 to February 2018. Using a wide variety of sources, these papers were examined so as to give a state-of-the-art literature review and to deepen one’s understanding of the diverse applications of VR in a tourism context. This paper also presents a novel classification of different VR systems according to the level of immersion and depicts their respective technological capabilities.


Findings
The advent of new VR hardware necessitates a distinction for different VR systems applied in the tourism sector. Research conducted during the past three years has been focussing on the application of head-mounted displays, which reflects the temporal development of VR technology. Regardless of the VR system, most studies examine VR as a marketing tool for promotion and communication purposes during the pre-travel phase, focussing on behavioural aspects. Advances in technology will yield new opportunities and application possibilities for the tourism industry.


Originality/value
The key contribution of this paper lies in its structural approach, which differentiates between non-, semi- and fully immersive VR systems in tourism, as well as the proposition of respective definitions. The concluding part of the paper proposes practical implications for tourism businesses together with directions for future studies.

Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research,"N. Balbo, F. Billari, M. Mills","This paper provides a review of fertility research in advanced societies, societies in which birth control is the default option. The central aim is to provide a comprehensive review that summarizes how contemporary research has explained ongoing and expected fertility changes across time and space (i.e., cross- and within-country heterogeneity). A secondary aim is to provide an analytical synthesis of the core determinants of fertility, grouping them within the analytical level in which they operate. Determinants are positioned at the individual and/or couple level (micro-level), social relationships and social networks (meso-level); and, by cultural and institutional settings (macro-level). The focus is both on the quantum and on the tempo of fertility, with a particular focus on the postponement of childbearing. The review incorporates both theoretical and empirical contributions, with attention placed on empirically tested research and whether results support or falsify existing theoretical expectations. Attention is also devoted to causality and endogeneity issues. The paper concludes with an outline of the current challenges and opportunities for future research.RésuméCet article présente un aperçu des recherches dans le domaine de la fécondité réalisées dans les sociétés dites avancées, c’est-à-dire les sociétés dans lesquelles le contrôle des naissances est l’option par défaut.

A Guide to Writing a Qualitative Systematic Review Protocol to Enhance Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing and Health Care.,"A. Butler, Helen G. Hall, B. Copnell","BACKGROUND
The qualitative systematic review is a rapidly developing area of nursing research. In order to present trustworthy, high-quality recommendations, such reviews should be based on a review protocol to minimize bias and enhance transparency and reproducibility. Although there are a number of resources available to guide researchers in developing a quantitative review protocol, very few resources exist for qualitative reviews.


AIMS
To guide researchers through the process of developing a qualitative systematic review protocol, using an example review question.


METHODOLOGY
The key elements required in a systematic review protocol are discussed, with a focus on application to qualitative reviews: Development of a research question; formulation of key search terms and strategies; designing a multistage review process; critical appraisal of qualitative literature; development of data extraction techniques; and data synthesis. The paper highlights important considerations during the protocol development process, and uses a previously developed review question as a working example.


IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH
This paper will assist novice researchers in developing a qualitative systematic review protocol. By providing a worked example of a protocol, the paper encourages the development of review protocols, enhancing the trustworthiness and value of the completed qualitative systematic review findings.


LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION
Qualitative systematic reviews should be based on well planned, peer reviewed protocols to enhance the trustworthiness of results and thus their usefulness in clinical practice. Protocols should outline, in detail, the processes which will be used to undertake the review, including key search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the methods used for critical appraisal, data extraction and data analysis to facilitate transparency of the review process. Additionally, journals should encourage and support the publication of review protocols, and should require reference to a protocol prior to publication of the review results.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5985bc5c71be1ec39b462084aafefe52c53fcf4,b5985bc5c71be1ec39b462084aafefe52c53fcf4

The use of logit and probit models in strategic management research: Critical issues,G. Hoetker,"The logit and probit models have become critical parts of the management researcher's analytical arsenal, growing rapidly from almost no use in the 1980s to appearing in 15% of all articles published in Strategic Management Journal in 2005. However, a review of three top strategy journals revealed numerous areas in their use and interpretation where current practice fell short of ideal. Failure to understand how these models differ from ordinary least squares can lead researchers to misunderstand their statistical results and draw incorrect conclusions regarding the theory they are testing. Based on a review of the methodological literature and recent empirical papers in three leading strategy journals, this paper identifies four critical issues in their use: interpreting coefficients, modeling interactions between variables, comparing coefficients between groups (e.g., foreign and domestic firms), and measures of model fit. For each issue, the paper provides a background, a review of current practice, and recommendations for best practice. A concluding section presents overall implications for the conduct of research with logit and probit models, which should assist both authors and readers of strategic management research.

Men and health help-seeking behaviour: literature review.,"P. Galdas, F. Cheater, P. Marshall","AIM
This paper reviews the key research literature regarding men's health-related help seeking behaviour.


BACKGROUND
There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services.


METHOD
The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions. A search of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library databases.


RESULTS
Studies comparing men and women are inadequate in explaining the processes involved in men's help seeking behaviour. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates ""traditional masculine behaviour"" as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention.


CONCLUSIONS
Principally, the role of masculine beliefs and the similarities and differences between men of differing background requires further attention, particularly given the health inequalities that exist between men of differing socio-economic status and ethnicity. Further research using heterogeneous samples is required in order to gain a greater understanding of the triggers and barriers associated with the decision making process of help seeking behaviour in men who experience illness.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc4cbee0b25185a27f9ba8e05cbaf1cc59424c09,fc4cbee0b25185a27f9ba8e05cbaf1cc59424c09

Parasocial Interaction: A Review of the Literature and a Model for Future Research,D. Giles,"This paper considers the phenomenon of parasocial interaction (PSI) used by media researchers to describe the relationship between media users and media figures (from celebrities to fictional characters). Although the concept has been used consistently across the past two decades in media research, it is argued here that it has not been sufficiently developed at a theoretical level to be taken up by psychologists. A number of key issues have not been addressed: firstly, how PSI might, as its originators put it, be ""integrated into the matrix of usual social activity"" (Horton & Wohl, 1956); secondly, how PSI might vary according to different types of media figure; and thirdly, what processes over time and media use bind user and figure into a ""parasocial relationship."" In this paper the existing literature on PSI is extensively reviewed, and an original model of PSI is developed for use in future social psychological research, which places PSI within the realm of ordinary social interaction and suggests ways in which different media use and different types of media figure interact to produce different styles of relationship. Finally, some applications of more detailed research into PSI are suggested.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b58a93b32c6c6bbc2e9006beff2a7e5f6493293d,b58a93b32c6c6bbc2e9006beff2a7e5f6493293d

Quantum walks: a comprehensive review,S. Venegas-Andraca,"Quantum walks, the quantum mechanical counterpart of classical random walks, is an advanced tool for building quantum algorithms that has been recently shown to constitute a universal model of quantum computation. Quantum walks is now a solid field of research of quantum computation full of exciting open problems for physicists, computer scientists and engineers. In this paper we review theoretical advances on the foundations of both discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks, together with the role that randomness plays in quantum walks, the connections between the mathematical models of coined discrete quantum walks and continuous quantum walks, the quantumness of quantum walks, a summary of papers published on discrete quantum walks and entanglement as well as a succinct review of experimental proposals and realizations of discrete-time quantum walks. Furthermore, we have reviewed several algorithms based on both discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks as well as a most important result: the computational universality of both continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/073d5c81219a52151a4eaab1b0d952b7e414e521,073d5c81219a52151a4eaab1b0d952b7e414e521
Empirical Research in Transaction Cost Economics: A Review and Assessment,"Howard A. Shelanski, Peter G. Klein","This paper summarizes and assesses the growing body of empirical research in transaction cost economics (TCE). Originally an explanation for the scale and scope of the firm, TCE is now used to study a variety of economic relationships, ranging from vertical and lateral integration to transfer pricing, corporate finance, marketing, the organization of work, long-term commercial contracting, franchising, regulation, the multinational corporation, company towns, and many other contractual relationships. The main insights and predictions of TCE-in particular, the importance of governing transactions-are becoming increasingly accepted. The empirical support for these claims, however, is much less known. We believe the empirical literature, on the whole, is remarkably consistent with the predictions of TCE-more so than is typically the case in economics. After presenting an overview of the theory and a discussion of some theoretical and methodological preliminaries, we summarize the major findings and discuss their implications, particularly the potential applications to public policy. In an appendix we provide a more comprehensive list of articles, arranged by type of study, as a reference aid for researchers.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af937df5af40d0406dad91f0ad46a352094e8371,af937df5af40d0406dad91f0ad46a352094e8371
Cloud Migration Research: A Systematic Review,"Pooyan Jamshidi, Aakash Ahmad, C. Pahl","Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36cede08a0747b284128dab53e793f214b672bc4,36cede08a0747b284128dab53e793f214b672bc4

Understanding Home: A Critical Review of the Literature,S. Mallett,"In recent years there has been a proliferation of writing on the meaning of home within the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography, history, architecture and philosophy. Although many researchers now understand home as a multidimensional concept and acknowledge the presence of and need for multidisciplinary research in the field, there has been little sustained reflection and critique of the multidisciplinary field of home research and the diverse, even contradictory meanings of this term. This paper brings together and examines the dominant and recurring ideas about home represented in the relevant theoretical and empirical literature. It raises the question whether or not home is (a) place(s), (a) space(s), feeling(s), practices, and/or an active state of state of being in the world? Home is variously described in the literature as conflated with or related to house, family, haven, self, gender, and journeying. Many authors also consider notions of being-at-home, creating or making home and the ideal home. In an effort to facilitate interdisciplinary conversations about the meaning and experience of home each of these themes are briefly considered in this critical literature review.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e61b4e2854f84e1663d92068f4d01f53bc5553a,6e61b4e2854f84e1663d92068f4d01f53bc5553a

What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior,"L. Bornmann, Hans-Dieter Daniel","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a narrative review of studies on the citing behavior of scientists, covering mainly research published in the last 15 years. Based on the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non‐scientific, reasons.Design/methodology/approach – The review covers research published from the early 1960s up to mid‐2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior‐reporting results in about 40 publications).Findings – The general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non‐scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite.

The paper considers the applicability of variables analysed along with research findings in the context of their implications for professional practice. This includes a review of methodological approaches commonly adopted throughout PA research, including a consideration of the nature and size of the samples used in relation to generalisability. Definitions and classifications of variables used within performance analysis are discussed in the context of reliability and validity. The contribution of PA findings to the field is reviewed. The review identifies an overemphasis on researching predictive and performance controlling variables. A different approach is proposed that works with and from performance analysis information to develop research investigating athlete and coach learning, thus adding to applied practice. Future research should pay attention to the social and cultural influences that impact PA delivery and athlete learning in applied settings.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e19d2deafcf265da173dd8847f8514282a74191,0e19d2deafcf265da173dd8847f8514282a74191
Error control and concealment for video communication: a review,"Yao Wang, Qin-Fan Zhu","The problem of error control and concealment in video communication is becoming increasingly important because of the growing interest in video delivery over unreliable channels such as wireless networks and the Internet. This paper reviews the techniques that have been developed for error control and concealment. These techniques are described in three categories according to the roles that the encoder and decoder play in the underlying approaches. Forward error concealment includes methods that add redundancy at the source end to enhance error resilience of the coded bit streams. Error concealment by postprocessing refers to operations at the decoder to recover the damaged areas based on characteristics of image and video signals. Last, interactive error concealment covers techniques that are dependent on a dialogue between the source and destination.

"INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL LITERATURE REVIEW: MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND MANAGEMENT","Richard Petty, J. Guthrie","The rise of the “new economy”, one principally driven by information and knowledge, is attributed to the increased prominence of intellectual capital (IC) as a business and research topic. Intellectual capital is implicated in recent economic, managerial, technological, and sociological developments in a manner previously unknown and largely unforeseen. Whether these developments are viewed through the filter of the information society, the knowledge‐based economy, the network society, or innovation, there is much to support the assertion that IC is instrumental in the determination of enterprise value and national economic performance. First, we seek to review some of the most significant extant literature on intellectual capital and its developed path. The emphasis is on important theoretical and empirical contributions relating to the measurement and reporting of intellectual capital.

Speaker Diarization: A Review of Recent Research,"Xavier Anguera Miró, Simon Bozonnet, N. Evans, C. Fredouille, G. Friedland, O. Vinyals","Speaker diarization is the task of determining “who spoke when?” in an audio or video recording that contains an unknown amount of speech and also an unknown number of speakers. Initially, it was proposed as a research topic related to automatic speech recognition, where speaker diarization serves as an upstream processing step. Over recent years, however, speaker diarization has become an important key technology for many tasks, such as navigation, retrieval, or higher level inference on audio data. Accordingly, many important improvements in accuracy and robustness have been reported in journals and conferences in the area. The application domains, from broadcast news, to lectures and meetings, vary greatly and pose different problems, such as having access to multiple microphones and multimodal information or overlapping speech. The most recent review of existing technology dates back to 2006 and focuses on the broadcast news domain. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art, focusing on research developed since 2006 that relates predominantly to speaker diarization for conference meetings.

Of the various methods available to researchers seeking to understand intellectual capital reporting (ICR), content analysis is the most popular. The aim of this paper is to review the use of content analysis as a research method in understanding ICR and to offer some observations on the practical utility of the method. Further, the paper examines several research method issues relating to the use of content analysis that have been discussed in the social environmental accounting literature, but not as yet in the IC literature, which we believe are relevant to investigations underway in the field of ICR. This paper reports on several developmental issues we have confronted when using content analysis to examine the voluntary disclosure of IC in annual reports by various organisations.

The assessment reveals that: (a) more studies have been conducted outside the USA; (b) the majority of the studies focus on manufacturing firms, with relatively few studies examining the service sector; (c) the majority of the export studies continue to focus on small to medium-sized firms; (d) there is a continuous increase in the sample size; (e) despite the problems that may arise from the use of single informants, it seems that none of the studies reviewed here collected data from more than one informant in the firm; (f) an increasing number of studies have been using the export venture as the unit of analysis; (g) the level of statistical sophistication has improved; (h) the use of control and moderating variables in export performance studies has increased; (i) more studies have started to include the external environment in their models, including domestic market characteristics; and (j) market orientation as a key determinant of export performance emerges in this review. Finally, conclusions are drawn, along with some suggestions for further research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7f93a2bf70757cba8970ad85c9877a76f4bbfaa,c7f93a2bf70757cba8970ad85c9877a76f4bbfaa
On-road vehicle detection: a review,"Zehang Sun, G. Bebis, Ronald Miller","Developing on-board automotive driver assistance systems aiming to alert drivers about driving environments, and possible collision with other vehicles has attracted a lot of attention lately. In these systems, robust and reliable vehicle detection is a critical step. This paper presents a review of recent vision-based on-road vehicle detection systems. Our focus is on systems where the camera is mounted on the vehicle rather than being fixed such as in traffic/driveway monitoring systems. First, we discuss the problem of on-road vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research worldwide. Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for vision-based vehicle detection. Methods aiming to quickly hypothesize the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed next. Integrating detection with tracking is also reviewed to illustrate the benefits of exploiting temporal continuity for vehicle detection. Finally, we present a critical overview of the methods discussed, we assess their potential for future deployment, and we present directions for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c8d8a2df11b4df22857a1b48a8a607ed3811d67,6c8d8a2df11b4df22857a1b48a8a607ed3811d67

The Strategic Management of Innovation: A Systematic Review and Paths for Future Research,"Marcus M. Keupp, Maximilian Palmié, O. Gassmann","Strategic management scholars have long emphasized the importance of innovation for a firm's competitive advantage and performance. However, the current state of knowledge about the strategic management of innovation is characterized by conflicting theoretical predictions, persisting knowledge gaps and theoretical inconsistencies. Adopting a ‘systematic’ approach to reviewing the literature, this paper combines different quantitative methods – co‐word analysis, cluster analysis and frequency analysis – to review 342 articles on the strategic management of innovation published in seven journals from 1992 to 2010. On the basis of these analyses, suggestions are developed for future research which could help to promote future theory development and provide relevant material for policy decisions that managers and executives have to make when they manage innovation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbc499cd4bb480fa3291b54d12683bac1a5cb77f,bbc499cd4bb480fa3291b54d12683bac1a5cb77f
Taking Stock of Temporary Organizational Forms: A Systematic Review and Research Agenda,R. Bakker,"This paper brings together the research on temporary organizational forms. Despite a recent surge in publications on this topic, there have been few attempts to integrate knowledge on what we know of such temporary forms of organization. In order to correct this, an integrative framework is proposed around four central themes: time, team, task and context. Within each of these themes, the paper offers an overview of the literature, the gaps in what we know, and what future directions might be taken by scholars hoping to contribute to this important and rapidly growing field.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/382c09e0ae82b0f4cfeaede1cd76d5dc41ca8c3f,382c09e0ae82b0f4cfeaede1cd76d5dc41ca8c3f
Phytoextraction of toxic metals: a review of biological mechanisms.,M. Lasat,"Remediation of sites contaminated with toxic metals is particularly challenging. Unlike organic compounds, metals cannot be degraded, and the cleanup usually requires their removal. However, this energy-intensive approach can be prohibitively expensive. In addition, the metal removing process often employs stringent physicochemical agents which can dramatically inhibit soil fertility with subsequent negative impacts on the ecosystem. Phytoremediation has been proposed as a cost-effective, environmental-friendly alternative technology. A great deal of research indicates that plants have the genetic potential to remove many toxic metals from the soil. Despite this potential, phytoremediation is yet to become a commercially available technology. Progress in the field is hindered by a lack of understanding of complex interactions in the rhizosphere and plant-based mechanisms which allow metal translocation and accumulation in plants. In this paper, four research areas relevant to metal phytoextraction from contaminated soil are reviewed. The review concludes with an assessment of the current status of technology deployment and suggestions for future phytoremediation research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89bf90a43fcb446f62db336d0202732ebbc2e292,89bf90a43fcb446f62db336d0202732ebbc2e292

What drives consumers to shop online? A literature review,"T. P. Y. Monsuwé, B. Dellaert, K. Ruyter","While a large number of consumers in the US and Europe frequently shop on the Internet, research on what drives consumers to shop online has typically been fragmented. This paper therefore proposes a framework to increase researchers’ understanding of consumers’ attitudes toward online shopping and their intention to shop on the Internet. The framework uses the constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a basis, extended by exogenous factors and applies it to the online shopping context. The review shows that attitudes toward online shopping and intention to shop online are not only affected by ease of use, usefulness, and enjoyment, but also by exogenous factors like consumer traits, situational factors, product characteristics, previous online shopping experiences, and trust in online shopping.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6807d08e05817f6ff8107be569bbbbbf24f3de3,b6807d08e05817f6ff8107be569bbbbbf24f3de3

This paper therefore provides a review of four decades of research in this area with the aim to provide a summary and integrative framework as a basis for future research. We found that the factors affecting the adoption of e-HRM can be divided into three areas: technology; organization; and people – we refer to this as the ‘TOP’ framework. In line with we divide consequences into those that are operational, relational and transformational. We also found that there has been a shift both in the goals for e-HRM, from efficiency to improved HR service provision and the strategic reorientation of HR departments; but also that the type of consequences that the literature focuses on has also changed from operational effects, to relational and then transformational outcomes.

Performance Measurement Systems in SMEs: A Review for a Research Agenda,"P. Garengo, Stefano Biazzo, U. Bititci","In recent years, literature has identified the increasing complexity of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and highlighted their sensitivity to differences in managerial culture and management systems. Research has shown that performance measurement systems (PMSs) could play an important role in supporting managerial development in these companies. In this paper, the literature on performance measurement in manufacturing SMEs is reviewed and the diffusion, characteristics and determinants of performance measurement in SMEs are analysed. Shortcomings in the performance measurement systems are highlighted and the many factors that seem to constrain PMSs in manufacturing SMEs are defined, e.g. lack of financial and human resources, wrong perception of the benefits of PMS implementation, short-term strategic planning. Moreover, using dimensions defined according to the information found in the literature, two PMS models specifically developed for SMEs are compared with generic PMS models. The comparison points out an evolution in PMS models over time; in particular, the models developed in the last 20 years are more horizontal, process-oriented and focus on stakeholder needs. However, it is not clear whether these changes are due to the evolution of the generic models or an attempt to introduce models suited to the needs of SMEs. To clarify this matter and better to understand PMSs in SMEs, further theoretical and empirical studies are necessary. The main issues still requiring investigation are listed in a research agenda at the end of the paper.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aeb3e4f3494ba7d994842ba29004e6071a8c06df,aeb3e4f3494ba7d994842ba29004e6071a8c06df
Adherence in Internet Interventions for Anxiety and Depression: Systematic Review,"H. Christensen, K. Griffiths, L. Farrer","Background Open access websites which deliver cognitive and behavioral interventions for anxiety and depression are characterised by poor adherence. We need to understand more about adherence in order to maximize the impact of Internet-based interventions on the disease burden associated with common mental disorders. Objective The aims of this paper are to review briefly the adherence literature with respect to Internet interventions and to investigate the rates of dropout and compliance in randomized controlled trials of anxiety and depression Web studies. Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled trials using Internet interventions for anxiety and depression was conducted, and data was collected on dropout and adherence, predictors of adherence, and reasons for dropout. Results Relative to reported rates of dropout from open access sites, the present study found that the rates of attrition in randomized controlled trials were lower, ranging from approximately 1 - 50%. Predictors of adherence included disease severity, treatment length, and chronicity. Very few studies formally examined reasons for dropout, and most studies failed to use appropriate statistical techniques to analyze missing data. Conclusions Dropout rates from randomized controlled trials of Web interventions are low relative to dropout from open access websites. The development of theoretical models of adherence is as important in the area of Internet intervention research as it is in the behavioral health literature.

A review of delay-discounting research with humans: relations to drug use and gambling,B. Reynolds,"Delay discounting represents the extent to which consequences, or outcomes, decrease in effectiveness to control behavior as a function of there being a delay to their occurrence. Higher rates of delay discounting are often operationalized as an index of impulsivity, and as such impulsive discounting may hold considerable potential for understanding fundamental behavioral processes associated with a range of problematic behaviors – including drug use and pathological gambling. This paper first provides a review of several assessment methods used in delay-discounting research with humans. Following, the delay-discounting literature related to drug use and gambling is reviewed. Consistencies across this literature are identified; and future research directions are discussed, which include (a) improving methods of assessment for delay discounting and (b) moving drug-use research progressively to causal interpretations, with high rates of delay discounting either predisposing to drug use or resulting from drug use itself.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a354f3644bb31f4df1ffa2b5d02e3e741821f9f,1a354f3644bb31f4df1ffa2b5d02e3e741821f9f

A Review of Empirical Capital Structure Research and Directions for the Future,"J. Graham, Mark T. Leary","This paper reviews empirical capital structure research, concentrating on papers published since 2005. We begin by documenting three dimensions of capital structure variation: cross-firm, cross-industry, and within-firm through time. We summarize how well the traditional trade-off and pecking order approaches explain these sources of variation and highlight their empirical shortcomings. We review recent research that attempts to address these shortcomings, much of which follows the following broad themes: i) Important variables have been mis-measured in empirical tests, ii) The impact of leverage on non-financial stakeholders is important, iii) The supply side of capital affects corporate capital structure, iv) Richer features of financial contracts have been under-researched, v) Value effects due to capital structure appear to be modest over wide ranges of leverage, vi) Estimates of leverage adjustment speeds are biased, vii) Capital structure dynamics have not been adequately considered. Much progress has been made addressing these issues, some of which has led to the study of an expanded range of capital structure topics, including debt maturity, loan and covenant characteristics, collateral effects, and alternative financing sources such as leasing and credit lines.

This research area has expanded rapidly, which warranted an update to the existing review paper by adding the recently reported studies in literature. This article reviews some of the recent advances of Raman spectroscopy in relation to biomedical applications starting from natural tissues to cancer biology. Raman spectroscopy, an optical molecular detective, is a vibrational spectroscopic technique that has potential not only in cancer diagnosis but also in understanding progression of the disease. This article summarizes some of the most widely observed peak frequencies and their assignments. The aim of this review is to develop a database of molecular fingerprints, which will facilitate researchers in identifying the chemical structure of the biological tissues including most of the significant peaks reported both in the normal and cancerous tissues. It has covered a variety of Raman approaches and its quantitative and qualitative biochemical information. In addition, it covers the use of Raman spectroscopy to analyse a variety of different malignancies including breast, brain, cervical, gastrointestinal, lung, oral, and skin cancer.

The sociology of chronic illness: a review of research and prospects,M. Bury,"This paper provides a review of research and debate in the held of chronic illness. It first outlines some general features of a sociological approach, and then goes on to use recent empirical studies of chronic illness to illustrate some of the main stages involved. These include: onset and the problems of explanation and legitimation, the impact of treatment, and the development of adaptive responses. An attempt is made to distinguish the use of the terms‘coping’, ‘strategy’and ‘style’in describing adaptation. The paper argues that a sociological approach needs to recognise the positive actions people take, as well as the problems they face. In this way, diversity in managing chrome illness, and the continuing need for a person-based approach to sociological work, are underlined",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28481b424653ded3cab4f92fd495cf6c7f1414de,28481b424653ded3cab4f92fd495cf6c7f1414de

Translation and back-translation in qualitative nursing research: methodological review.,"Hsiao-Yu Chen, J. Boore","AIMS
To examine the effects of the procedure of translation and the techniques used on the collection and interpretation of original language qualitative data for English presentation.


BACKGROUND
Nursing and health research increasingly use qualitative research for a broadened perspective on practice and research. In numerous qualitative nursing research papers, data are collected in the original language (example Chinese) and the findings are presented in English. No standardised procedures exist for evaluating the influences of translation on the trustworthiness of qualitative data in nursing research.


DESIGN
Translation and back-translation related literature review was conducted.


METHODS
This is a methodological review paper. Discussion. This paper discusses the factors influencing the quality of translation including translator, back-translation, culture and language. Additionally, the translation procedures reported in the literature and the author's experiences are considered.


CONCLUSIONS
The translation procedures described in qualitative nursing research can be summarised as: 1 Verbatim transcription of the content in original language, and then analysis of content; 2 Two bilingual translators are necessary to translate the emerged concepts and categories; 3 Back translate is employed; 4 An expert panel committee is involved in reaching final agreement on the translation.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Development of the translation procedures could provide qualitative nursing researchers with a guide when collecting data in one language and presenting results in another language. In this way, the necessary rigour in qualitative nursing research could be achieved.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/555896d340b0ada5d355c111edebc244a24d8d2b,555896d340b0ada5d355c111edebc244a24d8d2b

Motivation: Reopening the Research Agenda,"G. Crookes, R. Schmidt","Discussion of the topic of motivation in second-language (SL) learning contexts has been limited by the understanding the field of applied linguistics has attached to it. In that view, primary emphasis is placed on attitudes and other social psychological aspects of SL learning. This does not do full justice to the way SL teachers have used the term motivation. Their use is more congruent with definitions common outside social psychology, specifically in education. In this paper, we review the standard applied linguistics approach to this topic, and go on to provide an overview of research into motivation in mainstream education.

User Acceptance of Information Technology: Toward a Unified View,"V. Venkatesh, Michael G. Morris, G. Davis, Fred D. Davis","Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f444aecb9a6cc1219d6baf81c55f23dfce3d9788,f444aecb9a6cc1219d6baf81c55f23dfce3d9788

Proximity and Inter-Organizational Collaboration: A Literature Review,"J. Knoben, L. Oerlemans","The proximity concept is used in many different ways in the literature. These dimensions of proximity are, however, defined and measured in many different (sometimes even contradictory) ways, show large amounts of overlap, and often are under- or over-specified. The goal of this paper is to specify the different dimensions of proximity relevant in inter-organizational collaboration more precisely and to provide definitions of these dimensions. The research presented contributes to reducing the ambiguity of the proximity concept as used in the literature.

Based on the above, the following research question is addressed in this paper: ‘Which dimensions of proximity are relevant in inter-organizational collaboration and how are they defined?’ A systematic literature review is presented in order to disentangle the dimensions of the proximity concept. Based on this literature review, three dimensions of proximity relevant in inter-organizational collaboration are distinguished: geographical proximity, organizational proximity and technological proximity. Examples (case studies) from the literature are used to illustrate the current conceptual ambiguity as well as to clarify how the proposed dimensions of proximity reduce this conceptual ambiguity.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ea1fe52fbb7517c1d1e00c740588511f1103ba6,3ea1fe52fbb7517c1d1e00c740588511f1103ba6

Multilevel analysis in public health research.,A. Diez-Roux,"Over the past few years there has been growing interest in considering factors defined at multiple levels in public health research. Multilevel analysis has emerged as one analytical strategy that may partly address this need, by allowing the simultaneous examination of group-level and individual-level factors. This paper reviews the rationale for using multilevel analysis in public health research, summarizes the statistical methodology, and highlights some of the research questions that have been addressed using these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of multilevel analysis compared with standard methods are reviewed. The use of multilevel analysis raises theoretical and methodological issues related to the theoretical model being tested, the conceptual distinction between group- and individual-level variables, the ability to differentiate ""independent"" effects, the reciprocal relationships between factors at different levels, and the increased complexity that these models imply. The potentialities and limitations of multilevel analysis, within the broader context of understanding the role of factors defined at multiple levels in shaping health outcomes, are discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b051d3c6a870d488ef7c7e228ed4b1c6eb4657d,5b051d3c6a870d488ef7c7e228ed4b1c6eb4657d

Conceptual issues in local adaptation,"T. Kawecki, D. Ebert","Studies of local adaptation provide important insights into the power of natural selection relative to gene flow and other evolutionary forces. They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme · habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation ‐ divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80d7f8d66958b842f8751a5726b9b805f85e6949,80d7f8d66958b842f8751a5726b9b805f85e6949

Participants. —A planning committee of five scientists was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine to organize a workshop. This committee selected 15 other workshop discussants on the basis of their research expertise in issues related to the health implications of physical activity. Several relevant professional or scientific organizations and federal agencies also were represented. Evidence. —The panel of experts reviewed the pertinent physiological, epidemiologic, and clinical evidence, including primary research articles and recent review articles. Consensus Process. —Major issues related to physical activity and health were outlined, and selected members of the expert panel drafted sections of the paper from this outline. A draft manuscript was prepared by the planning committee and circulated to the full panel in advance of the 2-day workshop. During the workshop, each section of the manuscript was reviewed by the expert panel. Primary attention was given to achieving group consensus concerning the recommended types and amounts of physical activity. A concise ""public health message"" was developed to express the recommendations of the panel. During the ensuing months, the consensus statement was further reviewed and revised and was formally endorsed by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine.

Khalil","ABSTRACT Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR). Introduction: Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In this manner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overview to address broader review questions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: the PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis. Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership; extensively reviewed the literature; engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence; sought advice from methodological experts; facilitated workshops; and presented at scientific conferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020. Results: The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting. Conclusions: The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e3a62cb2e2df028511c2788b8ee37a489fe81e2,6e3a62cb2e2df028511c2788b8ee37a489fe81e2
An Essay on Fiscal Federalism,Wallace E. Oates,"This paper is a selective survey of fiscal federalism. It begins with a brief review and some reflections on the traditional theory of fiscal federalism: the assignment of functions to levels of government, the welfare gains from fiscal decentralization, and the use of fiscal instruments. It then explores a series of important topics that are the subject of current research: laboratory federalism, interjurisdictional competition and environmental federalism, the political economy of fiscal federalism, market-preserving federalism, and fiscal decentralization in the developing and transitional economies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed9b2f9c04a9644b95015e950696701df24514b0,ed9b2f9c04a9644b95015e950696701df24514b0
Face recognition: A literature survey,"Wen Zhao, R. Chellappa, P. Phillips, A. Rosenfeld","As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28312c3a47c1be3a67365700744d3d6665b86f22,28312c3a47c1be3a67365700744d3d6665b86f22

Evaluating the contribution of interpretative phenomenological analysis,Jonathan A. Smith,"Abstract This paper presents the results of a review of studies employing interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) obtained from three of the major databases: web of science, medline and psychinfo. Between 1996 and 2008, 293 papers presenting empirical IPA studies were published. Trends over time are presented. This is followed by a categorisation of the content area of that corpus. The biggest specific area of research within IPA is illness experience, it forming the subject of nearly a quarter of the corpus. The paper then describes a guide for evaluating IPA research which is used to assess the illness experience papers. Detailed summaries are provided of the papers rated as good. These summaries describe the substantive findings as well as the markers of high quality. The paper finishes with a summary of core features of high-quality IPA work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf92a66339a893533b811ebc09d325e5b6bf7a66,cf92a66339a893533b811ebc09d325e5b6bf7a66

Executive functions and developmental psychopathology.,"B. Pennington, S. Ozonoff","In this paper, we consider the domain of executive functions (EFs) and their possible role in developmental psychopathologies. We first consider general theoretical and measurement issues involved in studying EFs and then review studies of EFs in four developmental psychopathologies: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), autism, and Tourette syndrome (TS). Our review reveals that EF deficits are consistently found in both ADHD and autism but not in CD (without ADHD) or in TS. Moreover, both the severity and profile of EF deficits appears to differ across ADHD and autism. Molar EF deficits are more severe in the latter than the former. In the few studies of more specific EF tasks, there are impairments in motor inhibition in ADHD but not in autism, whereas there are impairments in verbal working memory in autism but not ADHD. We close with a discussion of implications for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cdd415281dbe1b80f660e2d559330c2889861a7d,cdd415281dbe1b80f660e2d559330c2889861a7d
An Overview of Recent Progress in the Study of Distributed Multi-Agent Coordination,"Yongcan Cao, Wenwu Yu, W. Ren, Guanrong Chen","This paper reviews some main results and progress in distributed multi-agent coordination, focusing on papers published in major control systems and robotics journals since 2006. Distributed coordination of multiple vehicles, including unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned ground vehicles, and unmanned underwater vehicles, has been a very active research subject studied extensively by the systems and control community. The recent results in this area are categorized into several directions, such as consensus, formation control, optimization, and estimation. After the review, a short discussion section is included to summarize the existing research and to propose several promising research directions along with some open problems that are deemed important for further investigations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4eceb166de3f0c96ceae657975b8394c890a4f4,b4eceb166de3f0c96ceae657975b8394c890a4f4
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology: A Synthesis and the Road Ahead,"V. Venkatesh, J. Thong, Xin Xu","The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems (IS) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the IS literature on UTAUT from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of UTAUT and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined UTAUT and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to UTAUT, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of UTAUT using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing UTAUT extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future UTAUT-related research using the proposed framework.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b742012401207ccc945e187a79b3ac797e9f4b15,b742012401207ccc945e187a79b3ac797e9f4b15

Leonard","Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) consists in the concurrent construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation.

Trevitt","SUMMARY There is increasing emphasis on the need for effective ways of sharing knowledge to enhance environmental management and sustainability. Knowledge exchange (KE) are processes that generate, share and/or use knowledge through various methods appropriate to the context, purpose, and participants involved. KE includes concepts such as sharing, generation, coproduction, comanagement, and brokerage of knowledge. This paper elicits the expert knowledge of academics involved in research and practice of KE from different disciplines and backgrounds to review research themes, identify gaps and questions, and develop a research agenda for furthering understanding about KE. Results include 80 research questions prefaced by a review of research themes. Key conclusions are: (1) there is a diverse range of questions relating to KE that require attention; (2) there is a particular need for research on understanding the process of KE and how KE can be evaluated; and (3) given the strong interdependency of research questions, an integrated approach to understanding KE is required. To improve understanding of KE, action research methodologies and embedding evaluation as a normal part of KE research and practice need to be encouraged. This will foster more adaptive approaches to learning about KE and enhance effectiveness of environmental management.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a69dc99d17520317462c1fd8aed5c4fa898abd36,a69dc99d17520317462c1fd8aed5c4fa898abd36
Neural Networks: A Review from a Statistical Perspective,"B. Cheng, D. Titterington","This paper informs a statistical readership about Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), points out some of the links with statistical methodology and encourages cross-disciplinary research in the directions most likely to bear fruit. The areas of statistical interest are briefly outlined, and a series of examples indicates the flavor of ANN models. We then treat various topics in more depth. In each case, we describe the neural network architectures and training rules and provide a statistical commentary. The topics treated in this way are perceptrons (from single-unit to multilayer versions), Hopfield-type recurrent networks (including probabilistic versions strongly related to statistical physics and Gibbs distributions) and associative memory networks trained by so-called unsupervised learning rules. Perceptrons are shown to have strong associations with discriminant analysis and regression, and unsupervized networks with cluster analysis.

The Internationalization of Chinese Firms: A Critical Review and Future Research,Ping Deng,"The important phenomenon that the internationalization of Chinese firms (ICF) represents has attracted increasing interest from scholars from multiple fields over the past 20 years (1991–2010). Although this proliferation of research has the potential to significantly improve understanding of Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs), the necessary step of consolidating and integrating extant knowledge is absent. This paper reviews the scholarship on the ICF and offers insights into the specific areas in critical need of further development. By focusing on articles published in major scholarly journals during the period 1991–2010, the authors develop a coherent framework to organize and review conceptual and empirical findings from disciplines as far ranging as management, international business, cross‐culture and area studies. Within the reviewed literature, three primary streams of enquiry are identified which focus on the antecedents, processes and outcomes of the ICF. Achievements within each of the three research streams are carefully reviewed using content analysis, whereby a number of important issues are identified which have remained consistently untouched, and recommendations are provided for future research, aimed at developing a more integrated research agenda on the ICF for management and international business scholars.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc1638f48f9529b0f7b433682fe5f9b10bbd3cfc,bc1638f48f9529b0f7b433682fe5f9b10bbd3cfc

Advances in Fruit Aroma Volatile Research,"Muna Ahmed Mohamed El Hadi, Fenghua Zhang, Fei Wu, Chunhua Zhou, J. Tao","Fruits produce a range of volatile compounds that make up their characteristic aromas and contribute to their flavor. Fruit volatile compounds are mainly comprised of esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, terpenoids and apocarotenoids. Many factors affect volatile composition, including the genetic makeup, degree of maturity, environmental conditions, postharvest handling and storage. There are several pathways involved in volatile biosynthesis starting from lipids, amino acids, terpenoids and carotenoids. Once the basic skeletons are produced via these pathways, the diversity of volatiles is achieved via additional modification reactions such as acylation, methylation, oxidation/reduction and cyclic ring closure. In this paper, we review the composition of fruit aroma, the characteristic aroma compounds of several representative fruits, the factors affecting aroma volatile, and the biosynthetic pathways of volatile aroma compounds. We anticipate that this review would provide some critical information for profound research on fruit aroma components and their manipulation during development and storage.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32bcb7a3e3cfa90689337f90870465206808c605,32bcb7a3e3cfa90689337f90870465206808c605

Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art,"F. Tao, He Zhang, Ang Liu, A. Nee","Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2d00d0a9c4f06f8a395a9775ee555e2e8693c22,d2d00d0a9c4f06f8a395a9775ee555e2e8693c22
Multiple imputation by chained equations: what is it and how does it work?,"Melissa J. Azur, E. Stuart, C. Frangakis, P. Leaf","Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) has emerged as a principled method of dealing with missing data. Despite properties that make MICE particularly useful for large imputation procedures and advances in software development that now make it accessible to many researchers, many psychiatric researchers have not been trained in these methods and few practical resources exist to guide researchers in the implementation of this technique. This paper provides an introduction to the MICE method with a focus on practical aspects and challenges in using this method. A brief review of software programs available to implement MICE and then analyze multiply imputed data is also provided.

STAKEHOLDER MISMATCHING: A THEORETICAL PROBLEM IN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE,"D. Wood, Ray Jones","This paper uses a stakeholder framework to review the empirical literature on corporate social performance (CSP), focusing particularly on studies attempting to correlate social with financial performance. Results show first that most studies correlate measures of business performance that as yet have no theoretical relationship (for example, the level of corporate charitable giving with return on investment). To make sense of this body of research, CSP studies must be integrated with stakeholder theory. Multiple stakeholders (a) set expectations for corporate performance, (b) experience the effects of corporate behavior, and (c) evaluate the outcomes of corporate behavior. However, we find that the empirical CSP literature mismatches variables in terms of which stakeholders are relevant to which kind of measure. Second, only the studies using market‐based variables and theory show a consistent relationship between social and financial performance, particularly those showing a negative abnormal return to the stock price of companies experiencing product recalls. Although this paper shows that the CSP construct is not yet well‐specified enough to produce stronger results, recent research suggests that much progress is being made both empirically and theoretically in developing valid and reliable measures of corporate social performance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6456363110afcf562fb25e7cfb7979d9ddfe705,f6456363110afcf562fb25e7cfb7979d9ddfe705

Data on eye location and details of eye movements have numerous applications and are essential in face detection, biometric identification, and particular human-computer interaction tasks. This paper reviews current progress and state of the art in video-based eye detection and tracking in order to identify promising techniques as well as issues to be further addressed. We present a detailed review of recent eye models and techniques for eye detection and tracking. We also survey methods for gaze estimation and compare them based on their geometric properties and reported accuracies. This review shows that, despite their apparent simplicity, the development of a general eye detection technique involves addressing many challenges, requires further theoretical developments, and is consequently of interest to many other domains problems in computer vision and beyond.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79ced39c474df5d944323a394dc0d5923c14b410,79ced39c474df5d944323a394dc0d5923c14b410

Principled missing data methods for researchers,"Yiran Dong, C. Y. Peng","The impact of missing data on quantitative research can be serious, leading to biased estimates of parameters, loss of information, decreased statistical power, increased standard errors, and weakened generalizability of findings. In this paper, we discussed and demonstrated three principled missing data methods: multiple imputation, full information maximum likelihood, and expectation-maximization algorithm, applied to a real-world data set. Results were contrasted with those obtained from the complete data set and from the listwise deletion method. The relative merits of each method are noted, along with common features they share. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the importance of statistical assumptions, and recommendations for researchers.

A Comparative Study on Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Photovoltaic Power Systems,"B. Subudhi, R. Pradhan","This paper provides a comprehensive review of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques applied to photovoltaic (PV) power system available until January, 2012. A good number of publications report on different MPPT techniques for a PV system together with implementation. But, confusion lies while selecting a MPPT as every technique has its own merits and demerits. Hence, a proper review of these techniques is essential. Unfortunately, very few attempts have been made in this regard, excepting two latest reviews on MPPT [Salas, 2006], [Esram and Chapman, 2007]. Since, MPPT is an essential part of a PV system, extensive research has been revealed in recent years in this field and many new techniques have been reported to the list since then. In this paper, a detailed description and then classification of the MPPT techniques have made based on features, such as number of control variables involved, types of control strategies employed, types of circuitry used suitably for PV system and practical/commercial applications. This paper is intended to serve as a convenient reference for future MPPT users in PV systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad07c195f384c8c9d7b975219fcc0fefddaefc62,ad07c195f384c8c9d7b975219fcc0fefddaefc62

Stability and Stabilizability of Switched Linear Systems: A Survey of Recent Results,"Hai Lin, P. Antsaklis","During the past several years, there have been increasing research activities in the field of stability analysis and switching stabilization for switched systems. This paper aims to briefly survey recent results in this field. First, the stability analysis for switched systems is reviewed. We focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of switching stabilization methods found in the literature are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a switched system by properly designing switching control laws. Note that the switching stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive problems in the switched systems literature. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stabilizability of switched linear systems is described here.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b9660a8147a9dffa1a120aa5a64c63835501f09,0b9660a8147a9dffa1a120aa5a64c63835501f09
Bibliometric studies of research collaboration: A review,M. Weinstock,"Scientific research is becoming an increasingly collaborative endeavour. The nature and magnitude of collaboration vary from one discipline to another, and depend upon such factors as the nature of the research problem, the research environ ment, and demographic factors. Earlier studies have shown a high degree of correlation between collaboration and research productivity, and between collaboration and financial support for research. The extent of collaboration cannot be easily determined by traditional methods of survey and observation. Bibliometric methods offer a convenient and non-reactive tool for studying collaboration in research. In this paper, several types of collaboration have been identified, and earlier research on collaboration has been reviewed. Further research is needed to refine the methods of defining and assessing collaboration and its impact on the organization of research and communica tion in science.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9fd60badc04d7e4767993bd53645867067ec3e6,c9fd60badc04d7e4767993bd53645867067ec3e6

Research on the alliance: Knowledge in search of a theory,A. Horvath,"Abstract Objectives: The aim of this review paper is to summarize the challenges facing research on the alliance now and going forward. The review begins with a brief overview of the development of the concept of the alliance in historical context. Method: A summary of what has been accomplished both within the psychotherapy research community and in other professions is presented. Current challenges facing this line of research are identified, including the existence of a wide range of operational definitions that results in a diffusion of the identity of the alliance concept. It is argued that the current situation generates risks to incremental growth in several lines of research. Conclusions: A case is made that a lack of clarity regarding how several variables within the broader category of therapeutic relationships fit together, overlap, or complement each other is also potentially problematic. Efforts to resolve the lack of a consensual definition are reviewed, and in conclusion, it is argued that a resumption of a conversation about the relationship in the helping context in general, and the alliance in particular, should be resumed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8534d11e0dd6cc854c80a0490c5de0bfd95dd90f,8534d11e0dd6cc854c80a0490c5de0bfd95dd90f
Realist synthesis: illustrating the method for implementation research,"J. Rycroft-Malone, B. McCormack, Alison M. Hutchinson, Kara Decorby, T. Bucknall, B. Kent, A. Schultz, E. Snelgrove-Clarke, C. Stetler, M. Titler, L. Wallin, Valerie Wilson","BackgroundRealist synthesis is an increasingly popular approach to the review and synthesis of evidence, which focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which an intervention works (or not). There are few published examples of realist synthesis. This paper therefore fills a gap by describing, in detail, the process used for a realist review and synthesis to answer the question ‘what interventions and strategies are effective in enabling evidence-informed healthcare?’ The strengths and challenges of conducting realist review are also considered.MethodsThe realist approach involves identifying underlying causal mechanisms and exploring how they work under what conditions. The stages of this review included: defining the scope of the review (concept mining and framework formulation); searching for and scrutinising the evidence; extracting and synthesising the evidence; and developing the narrative, including hypotheses.ResultsBased on key terms and concepts related to various interventions to promote evidence-informed healthcare, we developed an outcome-focused theoretical framework. Questions were tailored for each of four theory/intervention areas within the theoretical framework and were used to guide development of a review and data extraction process. The search for literature within our first theory area, change agency, was executed and the screening procedure resulted in inclusion of 52 papers. Using the questions relevant to this theory area, data were extracted by one reviewer and validated by a second reviewer. Synthesis involved organisation of extracted data into evidence tables, theming and formulation of chains of inference, linking between the chains of inference, and hypothesis formulation. The narrative was developed around the hypotheses generated within the change agency theory area.ConclusionsRealist synthesis lends itself to the review of complex interventions because it accounts for context as well as outcomes in the process of systematically and transparently synthesising relevant literature. While realist synthesis demands flexible thinking and the ability to deal with complexity, the rewards include the potential for more pragmatic conclusions than alternative approaches to systematic reviewing. A separate publication will report the findings of the review.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16a66261d6d1aa153af412b6efd504e24ae9c4c6,16a66261d6d1aa153af412b6efd504e24ae9c4c6
Physiological and health implications of a sedentary lifestyle.,"M. Tremblay, R. Colley, T. Saunders, G. Healy, N.

A review of rubric use in higher education,"Y. M. Reddy, H. Andrade","This paper critically reviews the empirical research on the use of rubrics at the post‐secondary level, identifies gaps in the literature and proposes areas in need of research. Studies of rubrics in higher education have been undertaken in a wide range of disciplines and for multiple purposes, including increasing student achievement, improving instruction and evaluating programmes. While, student perceptions of rubrics are generally positive and some authors report positive responses to rubric use by instructors, others noted a tendency for instructors to resist using them. Two studies suggested that rubric use was associated with improved academic performance, while one did not. The potential of rubrics to identify the need for improvements in courses and programmes has been demonstrated. Studies of the validity of rubrics have shown that clarity and appropriateness of language is a central concern. Studies of rater reliability tend to show that rubrics can lead to a relatively common interpretation of student performance. Suggestions for future research include the use of more rigorous research methods, more attention to validity and reliability, a closer focus on learning and research on rubric use in diverse educational contexts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1770e05b8f505a9c4c8ad501cccd15b8bccbbc91,1770e05b8f505a9c4c8ad501cccd15b8bccbbc91

Designing conceptual articles: four approaches,E. Jaakkola,"As a powerful means of theory building, conceptual articles are increasingly called for in marketing academia. However, researchers struggle to design and write non-empirical articles because of the lack of commonly accepted templates to guide their development. The aim of this paper is to highlight methodological considerations for conceptual papers: it is argued that such papers must be grounded in a clear research design, and that the choice of theories and their role in the analysis must be explicated and justified. The paper discusses four potential templates for conceptual papers – Theory Synthesis, Theory Adaptation, Typology, and Model – and their respective aims, approach for using theories, and contribution potential. Supported by illustrative examples, these templates codify some of the tacit knowledge that underpins the design of non-empirical papers and will be of use to anyone undertaking, supervising, or reviewing conceptual research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48083ef8c8b9082f0ec93af70ffe57e6efb24bf5,48083ef8c8b9082f0ec93af70ffe57e6efb24bf5
The role of children in the design of new technology,A. Druin,"This paper suggests a framework for understanding the roles that children can play in the technology design process, particularly in regards to designing technologies that support learning. Each role, user, tester, informant, and design partner has been defined based upon a review of the literature and my lab’s own research experiences. This discussion does not suggest that any one role is appropriate for all research or development needs. Instead, by understanding this framework the reader may be able to make more informed decisions about the design processes they choose to use with children in creating new technologies. This paper will present for each role a historical overview, research and development methods, as well as the strengths, challenges, and unique contributions associated with children in the design process.

A Model of Mindful Parenting: Implications for Parent–Child Relationships and Prevention Research,"Larissa G. Duncan, Ae J Douglas, Coatsworth Ae, M. Greenberg","This paper introduces a model of “mindful parenting” as a framework whereby parents intentionally bring moment-to-moment awareness to the parent–child relationship. This is done by developing the qualities of listening with full attention when interacting with their children, cultivating emotional awareness and self-regulation in parenting, and bringing compassion and nonjudgmental acceptance to their parenting interactions. First, we briefly outline the theoretical and empirical literature on mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions. Next, we present an operational definition of mindful parenting as an extension of mindfulness to the social context of parent–child relationships. We discuss the implications of mindful parenting for the quality of parent–child relationships, particularly across the transition to adolescence, and we review the literature on the application of mindfulness in parenting interventions. We close with a synopsis of our own efforts to integrate mindfulness-based intervention techniques and mindful parenting into a well-established, evidence-based family prevention program and our recommendations for future research on mindful parenting interventions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e079b0636bc2d77e52426b744aa0add9f2c67121,e079b0636bc2d77e52426b744aa0add9f2c67121
A Review for Aqueous Electrochemical Supercapacitors,"Cuimei Zhao, W.

Human resource management and performance: still searching for some answers,D. Guest,"Over the past 20 years, there has been a considerable expansion in theory and research about human resource management and performance. This paper reviews progress by identifying a series of phases in the development of relevant theory and research. It then sets out a number of challenges for the future on issues of theory, management processes and research methodology. The main conclusion from the review is that after over two decades of extensive research, we are still unable to answer core questions about the relationship between human resource management and performance. This is largely attributed to the limited amount of research that is longitudinal and has been able to address the linkages between HRM and performance and to study the management of HR implementation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0549cf54ac261ff81a8cc2ad65ef932b57126f1a,0549cf54ac261ff81a8cc2ad65ef932b57126f1a
Reliability of Capacitors for DC-Link Applications in Power Electronic Converters—An Overview,"Huai Wang, F. Blaabjerg","DC-link capacitors are an important part in the majority of power electronic converters which contribute to cost, size and failure rate on a considerable scale. From capacitor users' viewpoint, this paper presents a review on the improvement of reliability of dc link in power electronic converters from two aspects: 1) reliability-oriented dc-link design solutions; 2) conditioning monitoring of dc-link capacitors during operation. Failure mechanisms, failure modes and lifetime models of capacitors suitable for the applications are also discussed as a basis to understand the physics-of-failure.

"Review Article: Methods for Fault Detection, Diagnostics, and Prognostics for Building Systems—A Review, Part I","S. Katipamula, Michael R. Brambley","Part II of this article will be published in Volume 11, Number 2, April 2005. Poorly maintained, degraded, and improperly controlled equipment wastes an estimated 15% to 30% of energy used in commercial buildings. Much of this waste could be prevented with widespread adoption of automated condition-based maintenance. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) along with prognostics provide a cornerstone for condition-based maintenance of engineered systems. Although FDD has been an active area of research in other fields for more than a decade, applications for heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and other building systems have lagged those in other industries. Nonetheless, over the last decade there has been considerable research and development targeted toward developing FDD methods for HVAC&R equipment. Despite this research, there are still only a handful of FDD tools that are deployed in the field. This paper is the first of a two-part review of methods for automated FDD and prognostics whose intent is to increase awareness of the HVAC&R research and development community to the body of FDD and prognostics developments in other fields as well as advancements in the field of HVAC&R. This first part of the review focuses on generic FDD and prognostics, providing a framework for categorizing methods, describing them, and identifying their primary strengths and weaknesses. The second paper in this review, to be published in the April 2005 International Journal of HVAC&R Research, will address research and applications specific to the fields of HVAC&R",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a992de71d68db9c1d5160d957eefdfdb0b816190,a992de71d68db9c1d5160d957eefdfdb0b816190

It has been 13 years since the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was published. In that time there has been a remarkable growth in its acceptance as an outcome measure within the occupational therapy practice and research. Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to review the emerging research and clinical literature related to the COPM since 1994 and to document its impact upon occupational therapy practice and research throughout the world. Method. A systematic search was conducted to the professional and research literature in English publications (primarily occupational therapy). Eighty-eight papers that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed, 86% of which examined the COPM in relation to its psychometric properties (19 papers), research outcomes (33 papers) or practice (33 papers). Results. Overall, although there are a few limitations discussed in the review, the conclusion is that the COPM is a valid, reliable, clinically useful and responsive outcome measure acceptable for occupational therapist practitioners and researchers.

Effectiveness of Problem‐based Learning Curricula: Research and Theory,J. Colliver,"Purpose This article provides a critical overview of problem-based learning (PBL), its effectiveness for knowledge acquisition and clinical performance, and the underlying educational theory. The focus of the paper is on (1) the credibility of claims (both empirical and theoretical) about the ties between PBL and educational outcomes and (2) the magnitude of the effects. Method The author reviewed the medical education literature, starting with three reviews published in 1993 and moving on to research published from 1992 through 1998 in the primary sources for research in medical education. For each study the author wrote a summary, which included study design, outcome measures, effect sizes, and any other information relevant to the research conclusion. Results and Conclusion The review of the literature revealed no convincing evidence that PBL improves knowledge base and clinical performance, at least not of the magnitude that would be expected given the resources required for a PBL curriculum. The results were considered in light of the educational theory that underlies PBL and its basic research.

The Multilevel and Multifaceted Character of Computer Self-Efficacy: Toward Clarification of the Construct and an Integrative Framework for Research,"G. Marakas, M. Yi, Richard D. Johnson","Despite the recent empirical interest and advances in research with regard to the construct of computer self-efficacy (CSE), the results obtained to date have, in some cases, been either equivocal or contradictory. We suggest that such results may be attributable to a general lack of attention to the dynamic, multileveled, and multifaceted nature of the computer self-efficacy construct. We offer examples from the extant CSE literature suggesting weaknesses in existing measures of the construct as well as issues associated with manipulations and the need for control of antecedent and consequent factors directly associated with CSE. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide a thorough review of the extant literature related to CSE; (2) to present an integrated model of empirical findings, constructed from a wide variety of disciplines, that comprehensively defines the multifaceted nature of task-specific CSE in terms of its antecedent, consequent, and moderating factors; (3) to present a conceptual model of CSE at the general versus task-specific level; and (4) to use the two models of CSE to proffer guidelines for both measurement and manipulation of the construct. Through our review of the CSE literature, we offer several thoughts regarding the nature of the empirical results obtained to date. The combined objectives serve as a basis for establishing a foundation upon which future research investigating the CSE construct can be based.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5572830e6844050b771ea3c81cbb881497779432,5572830e6844050b771ea3c81cbb881497779432

Experimental Research in Financial Accounting,"R. Libby, R. Bloomfield, M.

Rather than provide an exhaustive review of the literature, we focus on how particular examples illustrate successful use of experiments to determine how, when and (ultimately) why important features of financial accounting settings influence behavior. We first describe how changes in views of market efficiency, reliance on the experimentalist?s comparative advantage, new theories, and a focus on key institutional features have allowed researchers to overcome the criticisms of earlier financial accounting experiments. We then describe how specific streams of experimental financial accounting research have addressed questions about financial communication between managers, auditors, information intermediaries, and investors, and indicate how future research can extend those streams. We focus particularly on (1) how managers and auditors report information, (2) how users of financial information interpret those reports, (3) how individual decisions affect market behavior, and (4) how strategic interactions between information reporters and users can affect market outcomes. Our examples include and integrate experiments that fall into both the ""behavioral"" and ""experimental economics"" literatures in accounting.

Framing the Frameworks: A Review of IT Governance Research,"Allen E. Brown, Gerald G. Grant","With the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States in 2002, and an ever-increasing corporate focus on ensuring prudent returns on technology investments, the notion of IT governance became a major issue for both business practitioners and academics. Although the term “IT governance” is a relatively new addition to the syntax of academic research, significant previous work is reported on IT decisions rights and IT loci of control, notions that are synonymous with the current understanding of IT governance. This paper presents a literature review for existing research in IT governance. A framework, named the Conceptual Framework For IT Governance Research is proposed to provide a logical structure for existing research results. Using this framework, we classify the previous literature on governance into two separate streams that follow parallel paths of advancement. A popular contemporary notion of IT governance is then presented, together with the argument that this new notion, by implicitly extending both streams of research, represents an initial amalgamation of the two paths of literature. We conclude that even with the consideration of contemporary structures, academicians and practitioners alike continue to explore the concept of IT governance in an attempt to find appropriate mechanisms to govern corporate IT decisions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50d04f9f0d1f729e1b937f58f02e1ee2d052ae0e,50d04f9f0d1f729e1b937f58f02e1ee2d052ae0e

"Sustainable purchasing and supply management: a structured literature review of definitions and measures at the dyad, chain and network levels","J. Miemczyk, T. Johnsen, M. Macquet","This paper provides a structured literature review of sustainability in purchasing and supply management, moving beyond the traditional environmental and social sustainability. The paper reviews the concept of sustainability at three levels of inter-organizational analysis - i.e. dyad, supply chain and network. The paper distils the nature and scope of existing research and synthesizes measures used to research sustainability across organizational boundaries. This literature review systematically analyzes existing literature. In particular, the review focuses on definitions and measures of sustainable purchasing and supply management to obtain an accurate view of current research. This paper uncovers two distinct trends in the type of research carried out. First, internal or dyadic issues are in focus and second, a tendency to deal with environmental, as opposed to social, sustainability. Despite the need to look beyond the dyad given the risks associated with the extended network, few studies do so in any of the sustainability dimensions. This review is limited by the method employed focusing on definitions and measures. Although the review considers supply chain and network research, it does so purely from a purchasing perspective, thus excluding issues such as logistics and transport. The paper identifies areas open to future research and provides practical insights into how sustainable purchasing and supply are measured. It also synthesizes existing measures of sustainability at different levels and organizes these into a taxonomy. The paper examines studies across multiple levels of analysis and integrates multiple fields of knowledge to show how research on sustainability in purchasing and supply is structured.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d79c91c6cb0e94c2a019b17c0c1d79ba4f8c11a,3d79c91c6cb0e94c2a019b17c0c1d79ba4f8c11a
Postgraduate research supervision: a critical review of current practice,"A. Mccallin, S. Nayar","Changes in the funding and delivery of research programmes at the university level have, in recent years, resulted in significant changes to research supervision. This paper critically reviews key influences effecting postgraduate supervision. Analysis draws on literature spanning 2000–2010 to determine the appropriateness of traditional models of postgraduate research curricula and supervision for the New Zealand context. Influences discussed include the research context, faculty issues, supervision pedagogy and models of supervision. Each area is analysed for strengths and challenges and contribution to the knowledge economy. From this review, the authors propose strategies for the development of postgraduate research supervision: faculty development, including supervisor education, and formalised research training for students.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e4ca3760b4b0129df0c5a2f22a3bcdb04912ce4,4e4ca3760b4b0129df0c5a2f22a3bcdb04912ce4

Strategy-as-practice,P. Jarzabkowski,"This review maps and critically evaluates the rapidly growing body of research in the strategy-as-practice field. Following an introduction on the emergence and foundations of strategy-as-practice, the review is structured in three main parts, based on the terminology, issues and research agendas outlined in the field. First, the paper examines the concepts of practitioners and praxis. A typology of nine possible domains for strategy-as-practice research is developed, based on the way that different studies conceptualize the strategy practitioner and the level of strategy praxis that they aim to explain. Second, the paper reviews the concept of practices, which has been adopted widely but inconsistently within the strategy-aspractice literature. While there is no dominant view on practices, the review maps the various concepts of practices that inform the strategy-as-practice field and outlines avenues for future research. The final section attends to the call for strategy-as-practice research to develop and substantiate outcomes that may better explain or inform strategy praxis. Five categories of outcomes are found within existing empirical studies and an agenda for building upon this evidence is advanced. The paper concludes with a summation of the current state of the field and some recommendations on how to take strategy-as-practice (s-as-p) research forward.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/236ca6c97903ef3c368d876e1d8455a0a78e6eb1,236ca6c97903ef3c368d876e1d8455a0a78e6eb1
Instruments for obtaining student feedback: a review of the literature,J. T.

These questionnaires can provide important evidence for assessing the quality of teaching, for supporting attempts to improve the quality of teaching and for informing prospective students about the quality of course units and programmes. The paper concludes by discussing several issues affecting the practical utility of the instruments that can be used to obtain student feedback.

MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012,"T. Liyanagunawardena, Andrew A. Adams, Shirley Williams","Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a recent addition to the range of online learning options. Since 2008, MOOCs have been run by a variety of public and elite universities, especially in North America. Many academics have taken interest in MOOCs recognising the potential to deliver education around the globe on an unprecedented scale; some of these academics are taking a research-oriented perspective and academic papers describing their research are starting to appear in the traditional media of peer reviewed publications. This paper presents a systematic review of the published MOOC literature (2008-2012): Forty-five peer reviewed papers are identified through journals, database searches, searching the Web, and chaining from known sources to form the base for this review. We believe this is the first effort to systematically review literature relating to MOOCs, a fairly recent but massively popular phenomenon with a global reach. The review categorises the literature into eight different areas of interest, introductory, concept, case studies, educational theory, technology, participant focussed, provider focussed, and other, while also providing quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year of publication, and contributors.

Reviewing a Decade of Research on the “Base/Bottom of the Pyramid” (BOP) Concept,"A. Kolk, M. Rivera-Santos, C. Rufín","In 1998-1999, Prahalad and colleagues introduced the base/bottom of the pyramid (BOP) concept in an article and a working paper. This article’s goal is to answer the following question: What has become of the concept over the decade following its first systematic exposition in 1999? To answer this question, the authors conducted a systematic review of articles on the BOP, identifying 104 articles published in journals or proceedings over a 10-year period (2000-2009). This count excludes books, chapters, and teaching cases. The review shows that the BOP concept evolved dramatically following Prahalad’s original call to multinational enterprises (MNEs). Deemphasizing the role of MNEs over time, published BOP articles portray a more complex picture, with wide variations in terms of BOP contexts, of BOP initiatives, and of impacts of the BOP approach. A simple framework for organizing the reviewed articles helps discuss findings, identify the gaps that still exist in the literature, and suggest directions for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9e153a118a8db0063a0a892f4ae808d93c1a58d,d9e153a118a8db0063a0a892f4ae808d93c1a58d

Giddens's Structuration Theory and Information Systems Research,"Matthew R. Jones, Helena Karsten","The work of the contemporary British sociologist Anthony Giddens, and in particular his structuration theory, has been widely cited by Information Systems researchers. This paper presents a critical review of the work of Giddens and its application in the Information Systems field. Following a brief overview of Giddens's work as a whole, some key aspects of structuration theory are described, and their implications for Information Systems research discussed. We then identify 331 Information Systems articles published between 1983 and 2004 that have drawn on Giddens's work and analyze their use of structuration theory. Based on this analysis a number of features of structurational research in the Information Systems field and its relationship to Giddens's ideas are discussed. These findings offer insight on Information Systems researchers' use of social theory in general and suggest that there may be significant opportunities for the Information Systems field in pursuing structurational research that engages sympathetically, yet critically, with Giddens's work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d816e96de2bdd6684331074287a50184067297dc,d816e96de2bdd6684331074287a50184067297dc
Form-Focussed Instruction and Second Language Acquisition: A Review of Classroom and Laboratory Research,N. Spada,"This paper presents a review of research which has investigated the effects of form-focussed instruction on second language acquisition (SLA). This includes descriptive/interpretive and quasi-experimental classroom-based studies as well as experimental laboratory-based research. The studies have been contextualised within the 'process/product' paradigm of classroom research (Rosenshine & Furst, 1973). This tradition, with its roots in first language education, has also had a considerable influence on classroom SLA research. Within this paradigm, the research process is viewed as cyclical with the elements of observation, correlation and experimentation contributing equally to the direction of the research and to the specification of research questions. The research under review emphasises quasi-experimental and experimental work, but related descriptive studies are also included. For the most part, the classroom studies are ones in which a form-focussed component has been included within second language (L2) instruction which is primarily meaning-based (i.e. where language is taught via content-based or 'communicative' instruction). The bulk of the research has been done with school-aged learners but related classroom studies with adult L2 learners are also included. The experimental laboratory studies have been done exclusively with adult L2 learners. The research is examined from an evolutionary perspective to demonstrate how research questions about the role of instruction in SLA have become increasingly precise and finely-tuned over the past two decades.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cb5a4711249e333ce52cc29db3ccd9919b5e175,8cb5a4711249e333ce52cc29db3ccd9919b5e175
Estimating the Causal Effect of Social Capital: A Review of Recent Research,Ted Mouw,"Although there is a large literature on social capital, empirical estimates of the effect of social capital may be biased because of social homophily, the tendency of similar people to become friends with each other. Despite the methodological difficulties, a recent literature has emerged across several different disciplines that tries to estimate the causal effect of social capital. This paper reviews this recent empirical literature on social capital, paying close attention to the statistical and theoretical assumptions involved. Overall, there is evidence that genuine progress has been made in estimating the effect of social capital. The reviewed articles should provide useful examples for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/707c808461dd74cc932466a0fc62ad97a99e47d0,707c808461dd74cc932466a0fc62ad97a99e47d0
External Relationships and the Small Business: A Review of Small Business Alliance and Network Research**,"Chris T. Street, A. Cameron","In order to thrive, small businesses are often advised to develop relationships with external organizations that have the potential to assist business development, survival, and growth. A focus on the external relationships of the small business underlines the vital importance of external resources in moving a small business toward increased success and profitability. Covering the period from 1990 to 2002, this paper reviews the small business literature as it relates to the use of these external relationships (such as organizational partnerships, networks, and alliances). In response to both academic and practitioner demand for further research in this area, an exhaustive analysis of the relevant literature was conducted and three “meta” research questions representing the connections within this literature were formed. The resource‐based view of the firm, resource dependency theory, and punctuated equilibrium theory are proposed as useful starting points for exploring these research questions and can give direction for moving forward in this research area.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4dfd17ddf4979f306bd64590c7d9b8b8abfdc3e,a4dfd17ddf4979f306bd64590c7d9b8b8abfdc3e

"Worklife, Diversity and Intersectionality: A Critical Review and Research Agenda","Mustafa F. zbilgin, T. Beauregard, Ahu Tatlı, M. Bell","Work-life issues have important implications at both organizational and individual levels. This paper provides a critical review of the work-life literature from 1990 onwards through the lens of diversity, with a particular focus on disparities of power induced by methodological and conceptual framings of work and life. The review seeks to answer the following questions: What are the gaps and omissions in the work-life research? How may they be overcome? To answer these questions, the review scrutinizes blind spots in the treatment of life, diversity and power in work-life research in both positivist and critical scholarship. In order to transcend the blind spots in positivist and critical work-life research, the review argues the case for an intersectional approach which captures the changing realities of family and workforce through the lens of diversity and intersectionality. The theoretical contribution is threefold: first, the review demonstrates that contemporary framing of life in the work-life literature should be expanded to cover aspects of life beyond domestic life. Second, the review explains why and how other strands of diversity than gender also manifest as salient causes of difference in experiences of the work-life interface. Third, the review reveals that social and historical context has more explanatory power in work-life dynamics than the micro-individual level of explanations. Work-life literature should capture the dynamism in these contexts. The paper also provides a set of useful recommendations to capture and operationalize methodological and theoretical changes required in the work-life literature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05101b73359df7c3f4d8007630a2ea267b4ab5c3,05101b73359df7c3f4d8007630a2ea267b4ab5c3

Research on Presence in Virtual Reality: A Survey,"M. Schuemie, Peter van der Straaten, M. Krijn, C. V. D. Mast","Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world. However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/551f062060c062a026a559d8d5d83ba708bc587b,551f062060c062a026a559d8d5d83ba708bc587b
Stability Criteria for Switched and Hybrid Systems,"R. Shorten, Fabian R. Wirth, O. Mason, K. Wulff, Christopher K. King","The study of the stability properties of switched and hybrid systems gives rise to a number of interesting and challenging mathematical problems. The objective of this paper is to outline some of these problems, to review progress made in solving them in a number of diverse communities, and to review some problems that remain open. An important contribution of our work is to bring together material from several areas of research and to present results in a unified manner. We begin our review by relating the stability problem for switched linear systems and a class of linear differential inclusions. Closely related to the concept of stability are the notions of exponential growth rates and converse Lyapunov theorems, both of which are discussed in detail. In particular, results on common quadratic Lyapunov functions and piecewise linear Lyapunov functions are presented, as they represent constructive methods for proving stability and also represent problems in which significant progress has been made. We also comment on the inherent difficulty in determining stability of switched systems in general, which is exemplified by NP-hardness and undecidability results. We then proceed by considering the stability of switched systems in which there are constraints on the switching rules, through both dwell-time requirements and state-dependent switching laws. Also in this case the theory of Lyapunov functions and the existence of converse theorems are reviewed. We briefly comment on the classical Lur'e problem and on the theory of stability radii, both of which contain many of the features of switched systems and are rich sources of practical results on the topic. Finally we present a list of questions and open problems which provide motivation for continued research in this area.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/153cdd1f5157ac76f0d499a8118c63808260de96,153cdd1f5157ac76f0d499a8118c63808260de96

Integrated Production and Outbound Distribution Scheduling: Review and Extensions,Zhi-Long Chen,"In many applications involving make-to-order or time-sensitive (e.g., perishable, seasonal) products, finished orders are often delivered to customers immediately or shortly after the production. Consequently, there is little or no finished product inventory in the supply chain such that production and outbound distribution are very intimately linked and must be scheduled jointly to achieve a desired on-time delivery performance at minimum total cost. Research on integrated scheduling models of production and outbound distribution is relatively recent but is growing very rapidly. In this paper, we provide a survey of such existing models. We present a unified model representation scheme, classify existing models into several different classes, and for each class of the models give an overview of the optimality properties, computational tractability, and solution algorithms for the various problems studied in the literature. We clarify the tractability of some open problems left in the literature and some new problems by providing intractability proofs or polynomial-time exact algorithms.

The paper divides the recent research into categories: the nature of coaching, coach behaviour studies, client behaviour studies, relationship studies and executive coaching impact studies and discusses research methods including Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, Grounded Theory and Discourse Analysis, randomised controlled trials, meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The third section considers the future direction research may take. It identifies key themes and sample research questions which the authors believe could be the focus of future research. The paper concludes by noting that coaching research is likely to continue to grow over the coming decade, and this growth offers an opportunity for the research–practitioner partnership to be strengthened and maintained.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aff1679c2cccfb8c758bfcdef3ed2f898403530a,aff1679c2cccfb8c758bfcdef3ed2f898403530a
A Model and Literature Review of Professional Skepticism in Auditing,M. Nelson,"This paper reviews research that examines professional skepticism (hereafter, PS) in auditing. Consistent with much research and with recent regulatory concerns, the paper defines PS as ‘‘indicated by auditor judgments and decisions that reflect a heightened assessment of the risk that an assertion is incorrect, conditional on the information available to the auditor.’’ In many circumstances the assertion in question will be a client’s assertion that the financial statements are free of material misstatement, but the definition could apply to other assertions as well (e.g., attesting to the effectiveness of a client’s internal controls). This definition reflects more of a ‘‘presumptive doubt’’ than a ‘‘neutral’’ view of PS, implying that auditors who exhibit high PS are auditors who need relatively more persuasive evidence (in terms of quality and or quantity) to be convinced that an assertion is correct. Depending on how an auditor’s decisions are evaluated, it is possible under this definition for an auditor to exhibit too much PS, in that they could design overly inefficient and expensive audits.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/072e09975a9bce46670c5755de8410e7872608f8,072e09975a9bce46670c5755de8410e7872608f8
Religious and Spiritual Factors in Depression: Review and Integration of the Research,"R. Bonelli, R. Dew, H. Koenig, D. Rosmarin, Sasan Vasegh","Depressive symptoms and religious/spiritual (R/S) practices are widespread around the world, but their intersection has received relatively little attention from mainstream mental health professionals. This paper reviews and synthesizes quantitative research examining relationships between R/S involvement and depressive symptoms or disorders during the last 50 years (1962 to 2011). At least 444 studies have now quantitatively examined these relationships. Of those, over 60% report less depression and faster remission from depression in those more R/S or a reduction in depression severity in response to an R/S intervention. In contrast, only 6% report greater depression. Of the 178 most methodologically rigorous studies, 119 (67%) find inverse relationships between R/S and depression. Religious beliefs and practices may help people to cope better with stressful life circumstances, give meaning and hope, and surround depressed persons with a supportive community. In some populations or individuals, however, religious beliefs may increase guilt and lead to discouragement as people fail to live up to the high standards of their religious tradition. Understanding the role that R/S factors play in preventing depression, facilitating its resolution, or leading to greater depression will help clinicians determine whether this is a resource or a liability for individual patients.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd4c0000b89758b3bf0445a7661ae156bdefb602,cd4c0000b89758b3bf0445a7661ae156bdefb602
Survey on Reliability of Power Electronic Systems,"Yantao Song, Bingsen Wang","With wide-spread application of power electronic systems across many different industries, their reliability is being studied extensively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of reliability assessment and improvement of power electronic systems from three levels: 1) metrics and methodologies of reliability assessment of existing system; 2) reliability improvement of existing system by means of algorithmic solutions without change of the hardware; and 3) reliability-oriented design solutions that are based on fault-tolerant operation of the overall systems. The intent of this review is to provide a clear picture of the landscape of reliability research in power electronics.

The servitization of manufacturing: A systematic literature review of interdependent trends,"H. Lightfoot, T. Baines, Palie Smart","Purpose: The servitization of manufacturing is a diverse and complex field of research interest. The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrative and organising lens for viewing the various contributions to knowledge production from those research communities addressing servitization. To achieve this, the paper aims to set out to address two principal questions, namely where are the knowledge stocks and flows amongst the research communities? And what are generic research concerns being addressed by these communities? Design/methodology/approach: Using an evidenced-based approach, the authors have performed a systematic review of the research literature associated with the servitization of manufacturing. This investigation incorporates a descriptive and thematic analysis of 148 academic and scholarly papers from 103 different lead authors in 68 international peer-reviewed journals. Findings: The work proposes support for the existence of distinct researcher communities, namely services marketing, service management, operations management, product-service systems and service science management and engineering, which are contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing. Knowledge stocks within all communities associated with research in the servitization of manufacturing have dramatically increased since the mid-1990s. The trends clearly reveal that the operations community is in receipt of the majority of citations relating to the servitization of manufacturing. In terms of knowledge flows, it is apparent that the more mature communities are drawing on more locally produced knowledge stocks, whereas the emergent communities are drawing on a knowledge base more evenly distributed across all the communities. The results are indicative of varying degrees of interdependency amongst the communities. The generic research concerns being addressed within the communities are associated with the concepts of product-service differentiation, competitive strategy, customer value, customer relationships and product-service configuration. Originality/value: This research has further developed and articulated the identities of distinct researcher communities actively contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing, and to what extent they are pursuing common research agendas. This study provides an improved descriptive and thematic awareness of the resulting body of knowledge, allowing the field of servitization to progress in a more informed and multidisciplinary fashion.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4f9c3642bb766f263bcb7daeac3129c2a2cdb84,a4f9c3642bb766f263bcb7daeac3129c2a2cdb84

ISO 9001 and ISO 14001: Towards a Research Agenda on Management System Standards,"Iñaki Heras‐Saizarbitoria, O. Boiral","Management system standards, also called meta‐standards, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations across the world. Although these management system standards are based on the same type of management principles and institutional arrangements, the literature remains scattered, with diverse studies focused on specific standards and published in various journals. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the academic research on meta‐standards through an integrative review intended to shed light on the main conclusions and substantial advances made in this area. This integrative review focuses more specifically on the two main meta‐standards which have been adopted by more than 1.3 million organizations worldwide: ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.

Using Knowledge within Small and Medium-Sized Firms: A Systematic Review of the Evidence,"R. Thorpe, R. Holt, A. Macpherson, L. Pittaway","This paper provides a systematic review of the literature on how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use and acquire knowledge. The review was undertaken as part of the Economic and Social Research Council's Evolution of Business Knowledge Programme. The paper describes the systematic review protocol and provides a detailed explanation of the methods used. From the review, it is evident that SME knowledge research concentrates primarily on the acquisition and use of knowledge, treating it as an asset that is transferred by routines. The findings suggest that research is focused in three main areas. First, on the influence and abilities of the entrepreneur to extract, use and develop knowledge resources. Secondly, on firm-wide systems and the social capital that facilitates knowledge exploration and exploitation. Thirdly, on the provision of knowledge and learning experiences through government policy. From a practical perspective, the review concludes that policies encouraging entrepreneurship and economic regeneration need to be more flexible and sensitive to the often complex contexts within which knowledge is used by SMEs. From a research perspective, and given the flexible, opportunity-oriented and often novel nature of SMEs identified in these studies, there is a need to consider the relational and embedded qualities of knowledge by which these characteristics are framed; qualities that resist conceptualization as some form of separable, material asset.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24ec22109e4da6e1f3b94bb144fa02293786a9e,e24ec22109e4da6e1f3b94bb144fa02293786a9e
Clustering Algorithms in Biomedical Research: A Review,"Rui Xu, D. Wunsch","Applications of clustering algorithms in biomedical research are ubiquitous, with typical examples including gene expression data analysis, genomic sequence analysis, biomedical document mining, and MRI image analysis. However, due to the diversity of cluster analysis, the differing terminologies, goals, and assumptions underlying different clustering algorithms can be daunting. Thus, determining the right match between clustering algorithms and biomedical applications has become particularly important.

Management Earnings Forecasts: A Review and Framework,"D. Hirst, Lisa Koonce, Shankar Venkataraman","SYNOPSIS: In this paper, we provide a framework in which to view management earnings forecasts. Specifically, we categorize earnings forecasts as having three components—antecedents, characteristics, and consequences—that roughly correspond to the timeline associated with an earnings forecast. By evaluating management earnings forecast research within the context of this framework, we render three conclusions. First, forecast characteristics appear to be the least understood component of earnings forecasts—both in terms of theory and empirical research—even though it is the component over which managers have the most control. Second, much of the prior research focuses on how one forecast antecedent or characteristic influences forecast consequences and does not study potential interactions among the three components. Third, much of the prior research ignores the iterative nature of management earnings forecasts—that is, forecast consequences of the current period influence antecedents and chosen character...",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22c8d19d54a5e3ca6fb0a74fed7275aadff2cbd2,22c8d19d54a5e3ca6fb0a74fed7275aadff2cbd2

A review of breast tomosynthesis. Part I. The image acquisition process.,I. Sechopoulos,"Mammography is a very well-established imaging modality for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, since the introduction of digital imaging to the realm of radiology, more advanced, and especially tomographic imaging methods have been made possible. One of these methods, breast tomosynthesis, has finally been introduced to the clinic for routine everyday use, with potential to in the future replace mammography for screening for breast cancer. In this two part paper, the extensive research performed during the development of breast tomosynthesis is reviewed, with a focus on the research addressing the medical physics aspects of this imaging modality. This first paper will review the research performed on the issues relevant to the image acquisition process, including system design, optimization of geometry and technique, x-ray scatter, and radiation dose.

Fathers in attachment theory and research: a review,I. Bretherton,"This paper provides a brief history of attachment research on fathers as a backdrop against which the other contributions to this volume can be viewed. Empirical research on child–father attachment progressed in four phases and began before Bowlby in 1969 published the first volume of his attachment trilogy. During each phase a different set of questions emerged. Initially, researchers compared fathers to mothers as potential attachment figures. More recent studies emphasize the notion that mothers’ and fathers’ roles as attachment figures and their influences on child outcomes may be different and complementary. At the same time, calls for a family approach to attachment studies are increasing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e30dfe21d232a528bb8505f163860f576239b394,e30dfe21d232a528bb8505f163860f576239b394
Improving Construct Measurement In Management Research: Comments and a Quantitative Approach for Assessing the Theoretical Content Adequacy of Paper-and-Pencil Survey-Type Instruments,"C. Schriesheim, Kathleen J. Powers, T. Scandura, Claudia C. Gardiner, Melenie J. Lankau","A cursory review of the measurement practices found in four diverse management journals is briefly reported, suggesting that the current authors’ concerns about serious measurement deficiencies in at least some subdomains of the field may not be groundless. Then, it is suggested that the demonstration of instrument content adequacy be demanded as an initial step toward construct validation by all studies which use new, modified, or previously unexamined measures. Although adequate content is a necessary pre-condition for instrument validity, there are no well-established quantitative methods for examining content adequacy. Consequently, the main focus of this article is to propose a new approach for the quantitative assessment of content adequacy and to illustrate this approach by evaluating a commonly-used job satisfaction scale.

Game-Theoretic Analysis of Cooperation Among Supply Chain Agents: Review and Extensions,"M. Nagarajan, Greys Sošić","This paper surveys some applications of cooperative game theory to supply chain management. Special emphasis is placed on two important aspects of cooperative games: profit allocation and stability. The paper first describes the construction of the set of feasible outcomes in commonly seen supply chain models, and then uses cooperative bargaining models to find allocations of the profit pie between supply chain partners. In doing so, several models are analyzed and surveyed, and include suppliers selling to competing retailers, and assemblers negotiating with component manufacturers selling complementary components. The second part of the paper discusses the issue of coalition formation among supply chain partners. An exhaustive survey of commonly used stability concepts is presented. Further, new ideas such as farsightedness among supply chain players are also discussed and analyzed.

Visions of Sustainability in Bioeconomy Research,"S. F. Pfau, J. Hagens, B. Dankbaar, A. Smits","The rise of the bioeconomy is usually associated with increased sustainability. However, various controversies suggest doubts about this assumed relationship. The objective of this paper is to identify different visions and the current understanding of the relationship between the bioeconomy and sustainability in the scientific literature by means of a systematic review. After a search in several databases, 87 scientific journal articles were selected for review. Results show that visions about the relationship between bioeconomy and sustainability differ substantially. Four different visions were identified, including: (1) the assumption that sustainability is an inherent characteristic of the bioeconomy; (2) the expectation of benefits under certain conditions; (3) tentative criticism under consideration of potential pitfalls; and (4) the assumption of a negative impact of the bioeconomy on sustainability. There is considerable attention for sustainability in the scientific bioeconomy debate, and the results show that the bioeconomy cannot be considered as self-evidently sustainable. In further research and policy development, good consideration should therefore be given to the question of how the bioeconomy could contribute to a more sustainable future. Furthermore, it is stressed that the bioeconomy should be approached in a more interdisciplinary or trans-disciplinary way. The consideration of sustainability may serve as a basis for such an approach.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b8880a7df913a534fc20925c80921844268286d,1b8880a7df913a534fc20925c80921844268286d
A Review of Social Media and Implications for the Sales Process,"J. M. Andzulis, N. Panagopoulos, Adam Rapp","Technology-based research has a long, storied history in the sales discipline. Beginning with the role of computers to laptops, moving to the influence of the Internet, onward to customer relationship management and sales force automation applications, and now to the role of social media, sales research is being shuttled into a new technological paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to review the role of social media in the sales force and the sales process. We begin the paper by providing definitions of social media and reviewing the role and importance of social media in business. An analogy between the rise of Internet usage in the sales force and the advent of social media is presented and discussed. Next, we discuss the challenges of social media in the sales and marketing interface and review four different business strategies to determine who “owns” social media within an organization.

Minimally Verbal School‐Aged Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Neglected End of the Spectrum,"H. Tager-Flusberg, C. Kasari","It is currently estimated that about 30% of children with autism spectrum disorder remain minimally verbal, even after receiving years of interventions and a range of educational opportunities. Very little is known about the individuals at this end of the autism spectrum, in part because this is a highly variable population with no single set of defining characteristics or patterns of skills or deficits, and in part because it is extremely challenging to provide reliable or valid assessments of their developmental functioning. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge based on research including minimally verbal children. We review promising new novel methods for assessing the verbal and nonverbal abilities of minimally verbal school‐aged children, including eye‐tracking and brain‐imaging methods that do not require overt responses. We then review what is known about interventions that may be effective in improving language and communication skills, including discussion of both nonaugmentative and augmentative methods. In the final section of the paper, we discuss the gaps in the literature and needs for future research.

The General/Academic Self-Concept Nomological Network: A Review of Construct Validation Research,B. Byrne,"This paper reviews research in which the primary focus was directed toward the construct validation of self-concept (SC) within an educational framework. Specifically, studies are included that investigate SC internally, with respect to its general facet (GSC) and academic facet (ASC), and externally, with respect to its relationship with academic achievement (AA). The literature is divided into two broad categories: within-network research and between-network research. Within these divisions, the studies are further classified according to their methodological procedures. It is concluded that SC is a multidimensional construct, having one general facet and several specific facets, one of which is ASC. Although important findings have been noted regarding relations among GSC, ASC, and AA, an overall conceptual model and operational definition of SC have not been established and universally accepted. A number of very recent studies, however, have provided increasing support for the hierarchical model. Although one study has determined causal predominance between SC and AA, the findings are considered tentative. Considerations of definition and conceptualization, together with construct validation techniques, are also presented.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c18c3f32debb68976acd1f5cd93c13586f098706,c18c3f32debb68976acd1f5cd93c13586f098706

Atlee","In this paper, we review current requirements engineering (RE) research and identify future research directions suggested by emerging software needs. First, we overview the state of the art in RE research. The research is considered with respect to technologies developed to address specific requirements tasks, such as elicitation, modeling, and analysis. Such a review enables us to identify mature areas of research, as well as areas that warrant further investigation. Next, we review several strategies for performing and extending RE research results, to help delineate the scope of future research directions. Finally, we highlight what we consider to be the ""hot"" current and future research topics, which aim to address RE needs for emerging systems of the future.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1056b5232117a60da926a9f6faa7087357ffcc2b,1056b5232117a60da926a9f6faa7087357ffcc2b

Online Prevention Aimed at Lifestyle Behaviors: A Systematic Review of Reviews,"Leonie F.M. Kohl, R. Crutzen, N. D. de Vries","Background Interventions aimed at behavior change are increasingly being delivered over the Internet. Although research on intervention effectiveness has been widely conducted, their true public health impact as indicated by reach, effectiveness, and use is unclear. Objective The aim of this paper is to (1) review the current literature on online prevention aimed at lifestyle behaviors, and (2) identify research gaps regarding reach, effectiveness, and use. Methods A systematic search in PubMed revealed relevant literature published between 2005 and 2012 on Internet-delivered behavior change interventions aimed at dietary behaviors, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, and condom use. Our search yielded 41 eligible reviews, which were analyzed in terms of reach, effectiveness, and use according to the RE-AIM framework. Results According to health priorities, interventions are largely targeted at weight-related behaviors, such as physical activity and dietary behavior. Evaluations are predominantly effect-focused and overall effects are small, variable, and not sustainable. Determinants of effectiveness are unclear; effectiveness cannot yet be unambiguously attributed to isolated elements. Actual reach of interventions is undiversified, mostly reaching participants who are female, highly educated, white, and living in high-income countries. One of the most substantial problems in online prevention is the low use of the interventions, a phenomenon seen across all behavior domains. Conclusions More research is needed on effective elements instead of effective interventions, with special attention to long-term effectiveness. The reach and use of interventions need more scientific input to increase the public health impact of Internet-delivered interventions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55ff9a1880e5fe0fcfc2904aefef455cd6d7f2c8,55ff9a1880e5fe0fcfc2904aefef455cd6d7f2c8

Most of the existing literature on children's participation has focused on children over five years old; however, a small number of studies have been undertaken with young children. Beginning with an examination of understandings of listening, the paper describes methodologies for gathering young children's perspectives, including traditional research methods and participatory approaches. Key themes will be described which have emerged from studies undertaken to date. Illustrative case studies undertaken as part of the review are used to support the limited published material in this field.

Peer review in a changing world: An international study measuring the attitudes of researchers,"A. Mulligan, L. Hall, E. Raphael","This large-scale international study measures the attitudes of more than 4,000 researchers toward peer review. In 2009, 40,000 authors of research papers from across the globe were invited to complete an online survey. Researchers were asked to rate a number of general statements about peer review, and then a subset of respondents, who had themselves peer reviewed, rated a series of statements concerning their experience of peer review. The study found that the peer review process is highly regarded by the vast majority of researchers and considered by most to be essential to the communication of scholarly research. Nine out of 10 authors believe that peer review improved the last paper they published. Double-blind peer review is considered the most effective form of peer review. Nearly three quarters of researchers think that technological advances are making peer review more effective. Most researchers believe that although peer review should identify fraud, it is very difficult for it to do so. Reviewers are committed to conducting peer review in the future and believe that simple practical steps, such as training new reviewers would further improve peer review. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a02d61459d3604f00a1324aa3f9462b6151514f6,a02d61459d3604f00a1324aa3f9462b6151514f6
Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research,N. Bayazit,"What Is Design Research? This paper will start to answer the above question with the definition of L. Bruce Archer: “Design research is systematic inquiry whose goal is knowledge of, or in, the embodiment of configuration, composition, structure, purpose, value, and meaning in man-made things and systems.” 1 In this paper, looking at design research from the design methodology and design science perspectives restricts our view in a sense that is necessary for such a topic. Design research tries to answer the obligations of design to the humanities: A Design research is concerned with the physical embodiment of man-made things, how these things perform their jobs, and how they work. B Design research is concerned with construction as a human activity, how designers work, how they think, and how they carry out design activity. C Design research is concerned with what is achieved at the end of a purposeful design activity, how an artificial thing appears, and what it means.

"Social media analytics: a survey of techniques, tools and platforms","Bogdan Batrinca, P. Treleaven","This paper is written for (social science) researchers seeking to analyze the wealth of social media now available. It presents a comprehensive review of software tools for social networking media, wikis, really simple syndication feeds, blogs, newsgroups, chat and news feeds. For completeness, it also includes introductions to social media scraping, storage, data cleaning and sentiment analysis. Although principally a review, the paper also provides a methodology and a critique of social media tools. Analyzing social media, in particular Twitter feeds for sentiment analysis, has become a major research and business activity due to the availability of web-based application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Twitter, Facebook and News services. This has led to an ‘explosion’ of data services, software tools for scraping and analysis and social media analytics platforms. It is also a research area undergoing rapid change and evolution due to commercial pressures and the potential for using social media data for computational (social science) research. Using a simple taxonomy, this paper provides a review of leading software tools and how to use them to scrape, cleanse and analyze the spectrum of social media. In addition, it discussed the requirement of an experimental computational environment for social media research and presents as an illustration the system architecture of a social media (analytics) platform built by University College London. The principal contribution of this paper is to provide an overview (including code fragments) for scientists seeking to utilize social media scraping and analytics either in their research or business. The data retrieval techniques that are presented in this paper are valid at the time of writing this paper (June 2014), but they are subject to change since social media data scraping APIs are rapidly changing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb75002cb73ec5c11a55258d56bc6353ea5032fa,bb75002cb73ec5c11a55258d56bc6353ea5032fa

Time for Space: A Narrative Review of Research on Organizational Spaces,"Scott Taylor, A. Spicer","This paper presents an integrated framework for studying organizational spaces. It suggests that existing research can be classed into three categories: studies of space as distance' studies of space as the materialization of power relations' and studies of space as experience. These approaches are drawn together using Henri Lefebvre&apos's theory of spatial production to argue that an adequate understanding of organizational spaces would investigate how they are practised, planned and imagined. Moreover, an adequate theory of space would account for multiple spatial levels, or scales. To illustrate the potential of the synthetic framework, a reading of three exemplary studies of multiple organizational spaces, from social anthropology and economic geography, is presented. The paper concludes by presenting a research agenda that indicates how data collection and analysis in established fields such as employee relations and international business might become more space sensitive by integrating such theorized cross-scale analysis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f0c1b7befa75a5124eb2095bfe6bc91cf6e560f,3f0c1b7befa75a5124eb2095bfe6bc91cf6e560f

Wood-derived fibers are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, but paper composition can also include additives, such as starch, minerals, and synthetic polymers. Therefore, paper is a multi-component material, and because of its complex and varied nature, research findings in paper chemistry can be difficult to interpret. Deterioration of paper is caused by many factors such as acid hydrolysis, oxidative agents, light, air pollution, or the presence of microorganisms. The origin of the cellulosic material, as well as pulping and papermaking procedures, additives, and storage conditions play a crucial role.

An overview of interpretive phenomenology as a research methodology.,"D. Tuohy, A. Cooney, M. Dowling, K. Murphy, Jane Sixsmith","AIM
To provide an overview of interpretive phenomenology.


BACKGROUND
Phenomenology is a philosophy and a research approach. As a research approach, it is used extensively in nursing and 'interpretive' phenomenology is becoming increasingly popular.


DATA SOURCES
Online and manual searches of relevant books and electronic databases were undertaken.


REVIEW METHODS
Literature review on papers on phenomenology, research and nursing (written in English) was undertaken.


DISCUSSION
A brief outline of the origins of the concept, and the influence of 'descriptive' phenomenology on the development of interpretive phenomenology is provided. Its aim, origins and philosophical basis, including the core concepts of dasein, fore-structure/pre-understanding, world view existential themes and the hermeneutic circle, are described and the influence of these concepts in phenomenological nursing research is illustrated.


CONCLUSION
This paper will assist readers when deciding whether interpretive phenomenology is appropriate for their research projects.

Learning to think like a physicist: A review of research‐based instructional strategies,A. Heuvelen,"Many studies in physics education indicate that our conventional instruction fails to achieve objectives we desire for our students. Students leave introductory courses unable to reason qualitatively about physical processes. They use primitive formula‐centered problem‐solving techniques. Their minds contain a small number of facts and equations that are accessible only by random searches. In recent years, research by scientists interested in cognition and pedagogy has shown that we can do much better. This paper reviews this research and the instructional strategies that are suggested by it. The following paper reports the preliminary results of using these strategies in introductory physics courses that emphasize problem solving.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/839eb6122948e9f1ed216ced86a212b87fcae2d8,839eb6122948e9f1ed216ced86a212b87fcae2d8
Comparative studies of risk perception: a review of twenty years of research,Å.

It considers attempts to study risk perception comparatively, from other theoretical and methodological perspectives, and discusses various issues that are highlighted in a comparative framework, relating to distinctions between 'objective' and 'perceived' risk, the role of communication and the media, the political system and various societal determinants such as marginality, gender and ethnicity. One of the main conclusions is that comparative studies of risk perception need to be further refined, both methodologically and theoretically.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/904a19c5d86ce8720929daa9c0282ea25316d060,904a19c5d86ce8720929daa9c0282ea25316d060
PAPER’S RESISTANCE TO WETTING – A REVIEW OF INTERNAL SIZING CHEMICALS AND THEIR EFFECTS,M. Hubbe,"This review considers research related to internal sizing agents. Such chemicals, when added as emulsions or in micellar form to slurries of cellulosic fibers before paper is made, can make the product resist water and other fluids. Significant progress has been achieved to elucidate the modes of action of alkylketene dimer (AKD), alkenylsuccinic anhydride (ASA), rosin products, and other sizing chemicals. Recent findings generally support a traditional view that efficient hydrophobation requires that the sizing chemicals contain hydrophobic groups, that they are efficiently retained on fiber surfaces during the papermaking process, that they become well distributed on a molecular scale, and that they need to be chemically anchored. A variety of studies have quantified ways in which internal sizing treatments tend to be inefficient, compared to what is theoretically possible. The inefficient nature of chemical and physical processes associated with internal sizing, as well as competing reactions and some interfering or contributing factors, help to explain apparent inconsistencies between the results of some recent studies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1df761939e22ca214e93eeb32ede6499ac0d63d7,1df761939e22ca214e93eeb32ede6499ac0d63d7

MANAGING PRODUCT VARIETY: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS,Kamalini Ramdas,"Variety management has emerged as a crucial dimension of successful business practice. In this paper, I first provide a framework for managerial decisions about variety. Variety‐creation decisions determine the amount, type, and timing of end‐product variety, while variety‐implementation decisions focus on the design and operation of internal processes and a supply chain to support a firm's variety‐creation strategy. I organize variety‐related decisions into four key decision themes in variety creation: 1) dimensions of variety, 2) product architecture, 3) degree of customization, and 4) timing; and three key decision themes in variety implementation: 1) process capabilities, 2) points of variegation, and 3) day‐to‐day decisions. I describe each theme and review the relevant literature on each theme, with a focus on research that provides insight to problems faced in practice. Finally, I identify untapped avenues for future research that would be of value to the practicing manager, paying special attention to interdependencies among decision themes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d761da33b65f2cc0df5286121c36667b9f9596e,3d761da33b65f2cc0df5286121c36667b9f9596e

Wheat from Chaff: Meta-Analysis as Quantitative Literature Review: Response,T. Stanley,"This paper presents and develops a quantitative method of literature reviewing and evaluating empirical research, meta-regression analysis or MRA. Economics is theory-driven. Yet, we must learn empirically if economics is to advance.

"Effectiveness of problem‐based learning curricula: theory, practice and paper darts","Geoffrey R Norman, Henk G Schmidt","In a recent review article, Colliver concluded that there was no convincing evidence that problem‐based learning was more effective than conventional methods. He then went on to lay part of the blame on cognitive psychology, claiming that ‘the theory is weak, its theoretical concepts are imprecise... the basic research is contrived and ad hoc’. This paper challenges these claims and presents evidence that (a) cognitive research is not contrived and irrelevant, (b) curriculum level interventions are doomed to fail and (c) education needs more theory‐based research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f18bb53e645d6c7c64ea85d2b22281555f6f1302,f18bb53e645d6c7c64ea85d2b22281555f6f1302
How to review a paper.,"D. Benos, K. Kirk, J. Hall","Most scientists acquire their training in manuscript review not through instruction but by actually doing it. Formal training in manuscript analysis is rarely, if ever, provided. Editors usually choose reviewers because of expertise in a given subject area and availability. If an individual repeatedly submits bad reviews, it is likely that that person will not be asked to review a manuscript again. Being invited to review a manuscript is an honor, not only because you are being recognized for your eminence in a particular area of research but also because of the responsibility and service you provide to the journal and scientific community. The purpose of this article is to define how best to peer review an article. We will stipulate several principles of peer review and discuss some of the main elements of a good manuscript review, the basic responsibilities of a reviewer, and the rewards and responsibilities that accompany this process. Proper reviewer conduct is essential for making the peer review process valuable and the journal trustworthy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84e94767c702a75ef370146f921d70676f209638,84e94767c702a75ef370146f921d70676f209638
The paucity of multimethod research: a review of the information systems literature,J. Mingers,"Abstract.  It has commonly been argued that the use of different research methods within the information system (IS) discipline and within individual pieces of research will produce richer and more reliable results. This paper reports on a survey of the IS literature to discover the extent of multimethod research. The findings are that such work is relatively scarce, and where it occurs involves only a small set of traditional methods. Possible reasons for this are discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2afbe541fc07a7884f5cc22fd4a1316039bdf323,2afbe541fc07a7884f5cc22fd4a1316039bdf323

Critical thinking in education: a review,"R. Pithers, Rebecca Soden","National governments and employers have argued that it is important for all sectors of education to prepare individuals who are able to think well and for themselves. 'Good thinking' and 'thinking well' are commonly used terms bound up with what is called 'critical thinking' in the research literature. Evidence is presented in this paper, however, which suggests that not all students may be good at critical thinking; nor do some teachers appear to teach students 'good thinking' skills. A review of the research literature in this area was undertaken and the methods and conceptions of teaching likely to inhibit and enhance critical thinking are outlined, as well as what is required to improve students' thinking skills. Ways forward in teaching critical thinking, and in helping students to learn to think well and for themselves, are described and discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8abd167ecad9d85dc7e37089e1c8667e23bc20fc,8abd167ecad9d85dc7e37089e1c8667e23bc20fc

Integrative reviews of nursing research.,L. Ganong,"Integrative reviews of research are a valuable part of the process of creating and organizing a body of literature. It has been argued that integrative reviews should be held to the same standards of clarity, rigor, and replication as primary research.

Putting Process (Back) in: Research on the Internationalization Process of the Firm,"Catherine Welch, Eriikka Paavilainen-Mäntymäki","This paper provides a critique of existing research on the internationalization process of the firm and proposes an agenda for future inquiry. In recent years, process approaches have received increasing attention in management research, leading to a more refined understanding of the distinction between process and variance paradigms. We apply a process lens to a well‐established sub‐field of international business, namely the internationalization process of the firm. We review how this research tradition has evolved over four decades. The review commences with a reassessment of the seminal ‘stage models’ that date back to the 1970s. It then proceeds to classify subsequent research on the basis of whether it includes process data and/or process theorizing. It is found that the majority of studies in this review do not combine process data with process theorizing. We show how, even in studies that contain some process elements, a process approach is not always sustained throughout the paper. On the basis of this review, six research themes are proposed, which would form the basis for a process agenda for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0d00208bfbc94a24d700eff8c8c9aba057b550a7,0d00208bfbc94a24d700eff8c8c9aba057b550a7
A Survey of Machine Scheduling Problems with Blocking and No-Wait in Process,"Nicholas G. Hall, C. Sriskandarajah","An important class of machine scheduling problems is characterized by a no-wait or blocking production environment, where there is no intermediate buffer between machines. In a no-wait environment, a job must be processed from start to completion, without any interruption either on or between machines. Blocking occurs when a job, having completed processing on a machine, remains on the machine until a downstream machine becomes available for processing. A no-wait or blocking production environment typically arises from characteristics of the processing technology itself, or from the absence of storage capacity between operations of a job. In this review paper, we describe several well-documented applications of no-wait and blocking scheduling models and illustrate some ways in which the increasing use of modern manufacturing methods gives rise to other applications. We review the computational complexity of a wide variety of no-wait and blocking scheduling problems and describe several problems which remain open as to complexity. We study several deterministic flowshop, jobshop, and openshop problems and describe efficient and enumerative algorithms, as well as heuristics and results about their performance. The literature on stochastic no-wait and blocking scheduling problems is also reviewed. Finally, we provide some suggestions for future research directions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0da475efbfaee5774377452c648f8b393a0e68fe,0da475efbfaee5774377452c648f8b393a0e68fe

Gradual Internationalization vs Born-Global/International new venture models,"J. Paul, Alexander Rosado-Serrano","
Purpose
During the last two decades, studies on the theoretical models in the area of international business (IB), such as gradual internationalization and the born-global firms, have gained the attention of researchers. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the studies on the process of internationalization (Gradual Internationalization vs Born-Global/International new venture models) to identify the research gaps in this area and to prepare a future research agenda.


Design/methodology/approach
Systematic literature review method was employed for this review. The authors highlight the findings from prior studies, compare and contrast salient characteristics and features, based on the articles published in journals with an impact factor score of at least 1.0, and provide directions for research.


Findings
The authors find that there are several areas that were under-explored in prior research. There is a great potential for theoretical extension and theory development in this field as it covers the tenets of four subjects: IB, marketing, strategic management and entrepreneurship.


Originality/value
There is no comprehensive/integrated review exploring the methods/variables and constructs used in prior studies integrating gradual internationalization/born-global models based on all the articles published in well-regarded academic journals. This review seeks to provide deeper insights, which help us to contribute toward the development of this research field.

Viewing systematic reviews and meta-analysis in social research through different lenses,"Jacqueline Davis, K. Mengersen, Sarah Bennett, Lorraine Mazerolle","Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are used to combine results across studies to determine an overall effect. Meta-analysis is especially useful for combining evidence to inform social policy, but meta-analyses of applied social science research may encounter practical issues arising from the nature of the research domain. The current paper identifies potential resolutions to four issues that may be encountered in systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social research. The four issues are: scoping and targeting research questions appropriate for meta-analysis; selecting eligibility criteria where primary studies vary in research design and choice of outcome measures; dealing with inconsistent reporting in primary studies; and identifying sources of heterogeneity with multiple confounded moderators. The paper presents an overview of each issue with a review of potential resolutions, identified from similar issues encountered in meta-analysis in medical and biological sciences. The discussion aims to share and improve methodology in systematic reviews and meta-analysis by promoting cross-disciplinary communication, that is, to encourage ‘viewing through different lenses’.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b9a820359d074907b1b16c6c9a44a013ff3c0aa,0b9a820359d074907b1b16c6c9a44a013ff3c0aa

In this paper, we review the dominant paradigms in contemporary nonmarket research and report on the key insights and findings from those perspectives. We use this review to suggest that the integration of institutional and strategic perspectives provides a logical path for the continued development of nonmarket strategy research going forward. Looking ahead, our premise is that institutional perspectives will have an increased relevance to nonmarket scholarship, particularly with the increasing importance of emergent economies to international business. As companies are required to invest more in nonmarket practices, and adapt those practices to unique country contexts, we anticipate that research will increasingly draw from multiple conceptual paradigms and perspectives.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57338521d3e78dd88350b535b02309f06041d514,57338521d3e78dd88350b535b02309f06041d514
Housing and public health.,M. Shaw,"This review considers the broad area of housing and public health, one of the traditional and core areas of public health research and intervention. The review takes into account the range of factors, acting at different levels, directly and indirectly, through which housing affects health. In public health terms, housing affects health in a myriad of relatively minor ways, in total forming one of the key social determinants of health. The paper closes by considering how the improvement of housing and neighborhoods has been a core activity of public health and a central component in tackling poverty. Investment in housing can be more than an investment in bricks and mortar: It can also form a foundation for the future health and well-being of the population. Addressing poor-quality housing and detrimental neighborhoods, in the broadest sense, is thus a task that should be grasped with vigor and determination by all those involved in public health.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffe40aa1e1d23ba5bfaba88e06760e14ec5692c2,ffe40aa1e1d23ba5bfaba88e06760e14ec5692c2

Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED): a review and modern bibliography,"Dr Paul Michael Cozens, G. Saville, D. Hillier","Purpose 
 
 
 
– The purpose of this paper is to critically review the core findings from recently published place‐based crime prevention research. The paper aims to critically evaluate the available evidence on the contribution of crime prevention through environmental design as a crime prevention strategy. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– Large‐scale evaluations of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) are reviewed with a view to clarifying current knowledge on the evidence of crime prevention through environmental design. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
– The review concludes that there is a growing body of research that supports the assertion that crime prevention through environmental design is effective in reducing both crime and fear of crime in the community. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
– Although the paper may not review all the evaluations of CPTED, it nonetheless provides a detailed compilation and overview of the most significant research in the area, including an extensive and modern bibliography on the subject. Research implications will be the subject of a forthcoming paper. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
– CPTED is an increasingly fashionable approach and is being implemented on a global scale. Additionally, individual components such as territoriality, surveillance, maintenance, access control, activity support and target‐hardening are being widely deployed. However, the evidence currently available is inconclusive and much criticised, which effectively prevents widespread intervention and investment by central government. The paper details the difficulties associated with demonstrating the effectiveness of CPTED. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
– The paper concludes that although empirical proof has not been definitively demonstrated, there is a large and growing body of research, which supports the assertion that crime prevention through environmental design is a pragmatic and effective crime prevention tool.

"Exploring the forest–poverty link: key concepts, issues and research implications","A. Angelsen, S. Wunder","This paper provides a global review of the link from forests to poverty alleviation. Definitions are clarified and the key concepts and indicators related to livelihoods and policy reduction and prevention are explored--distinguishing between the analysis and the measurements of poverty. Reviewing the macro-level literature on the relationship between economic growth, inequality and poverty, the authors found that economic growth usually does trickle down to the poor and that poverty reduction without growth is in practice very difficult to achieve. The potentials and limitations of forests in regard to poverty allevition are canvassed and their possible roles as safety nets, poverty traps and pathways out of poverty are explored. The core discussion addresses how forests can contribute to poverty reduction, distinguishing three main benefit categories. Firstly, non-timber forest products serve subsistence needs, may have important gap filling or safety net functions. Secondly, timber has not traditionally been very pro-poor but the current trends of increased local ownership of natural forests, growing tree commercialisation and small scale wood processing could modify that picture. Thirdly, ecological service payments are emerging rapidly but it is uncertain how much the poor will benefit. In conclusion, this paper outlines ten promising research topics, within three broader fields: assessing current forest-based benefits to the poor; exploring emerging market opportunities; and evaluating cross-cutting institutional and extra-sectoral issues.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6416800126675f2b4459e0d3be885eb6ebbb6f5c,6416800126675f2b4459e0d3be885eb6ebbb6f5c

The application of vignettes in social and nursing research.,"R. Hughes, M. Huby","AIM
The aim of this paper is to review the potential for, and the limitations of, the use of vignettes in research that seeks an understanding of people's attitudes, perceptions and beliefs, particularly with regard to sensitive subjects such as health care.


BACKGROUND
Vignettes, in the form of text or pictures presented to research participants to prompt responses to interview questions, are widely used throughout the social sciences although their use in nursing research is less developed. REVIEW FOCUS: This review paper begins by addressing the differences between vignettes and real life processes. The following sections explore some of the practical advantages and pitfalls of using vignettes in social and nursing research.


CONCLUSION
The paper demonstrates how vignettes can be very useful research tools yielding valuable data when studying people's attitudes, perceptions and beliefs in social and nursing research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5fa73b147d77721c63a34beeeaeb071e0d86244,a5fa73b147d77721c63a34beeeaeb071e0d86244

Case-based reasoning: A review,"I. Watson, F. Marir","Abstract Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a relatively recent problem solving technique that is attracting increasing attention. However, the number of people with first-hand theoretical or practical experience of CBR is still small. The main objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject to people new to CBR. The paper outlines the development of CBR in the US in the 1980s. It describes the fundamental techniques of CBR and contrasts its approach to that of model-based reasoning systems.1 A critical review of currently available CBR software tools is followed by descriptions of CBR applications both from academic research and, in more detail, three CBR systems that are presently being used commercially. Each of the three commercial case studies highlights features that made CBR particularly suitable for the application. Moreover, the last case study describes a development methodology for implementing CBR systems. The paper concludes with a research agenda for CBR.

A Review of Methods for Missing Data,T. Pigott,"This paper reviews methods for handling missing data in a research study. Many researchers use ad hoc methods such as complete case analysis, available case analysis (pairwise deletion), or single-value imputation. Though these methods are easily implemented, they require assumptions about the data that rarely hold in practice. Model-based methods such as maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm and multiple imputation hold more promise for dealing with difficulties caused by missing data. While model-based methods require specialized computer programs and assumptions about the nature of the missing data, these methods are appropriate for a wider range of situations than the more commonly used ad hoc methods.

Foxing on Paper: A Literature Review,Soyeon Choi,"Abstract There has been a large amount of research published on foxing formation. This paper reviews selected literature published between 1930 and 2003 to show the progression of the research approach on this subject and to suggest areas for further discussion and research. Metals and microorganisms have been considered the main causes of foxing formation. Scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis for inorganic and organic compounds were the main tools for finding the presence of metals and/or microorganisms in foxing spots. Newer research has focused on the condition of the affected paper itself by measuring the amount of free radicals and different functional groups formed by oxidation or acid hydrolysis. Certain foxing spots were found not to be associated with the presumed causes, i.e. metals or microorganisms. As a result, new hypotheses have developed on foxing formation including preferential cellulose oxidation or moisture condensation related to the non-homogeneity of the paper. Suggested treatment methods for foxing removal have included: mechanically removing metal inclusions and fungal spores, aqueous washing, oxidizing or reducing bleaching, chelating metals and enzyme treatment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d87d3ffa041c764696e175aabed372a6cc904f7b,d87d3ffa041c764696e175aabed372a6cc904f7b

Spiritual coping strategies: a review of the nursing research literature.,"Donia R. Baldacchino, P. Draper","AIMS OF THE PAPER
This paper reviews some of the limited nursing research-based literature, orientated towards the use of spiritual coping strategies in illness. This review aims at identifying those spiritual coping strategies used by the believers and nonbelievers followed by implications for holistic nursing care.


LITERATURE SEARCH
The CINAHL and MEDLINE CD Rom databases were searched, identifying literature published from 1975 onwards which amounted to 187 articles. The majority of the literature traced were found anecdotal with only few studies investigating directly spiritual coping strategies. Following scrutiny of the available articles, only five research studies explored directly the spiritual coping strategies used in various illness, four of which were conducted in USA and one in UK. Because of the small scale research studies, generalization of the findings of this review is limited to the samples used.


THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Research suggests that spiritual coping strategies, involving relationship with self, others, Ultimate other/God or nature were found to help individuals to cope with their ailments. This may be because of finding meaning, purpose and hope, which may nurture individuals in their suffering. Spirituality is oftenly referred by literature as being synonymous with religiosity. Thus the use of spiritual coping strategies is restricted to individuals who hold religious beliefs. However, the definition of spirituality indicates that this concept is broader than religiosity. The theories on stress-coping (Folkman & Lazarus 1984) and the numinous experience (Otto 1950) outline the rationale for the use of these strategies which are applicable to both the believers and nonbelievers.


IMPLICATIONS
This review suggests that the onset of illness may render the individual, being a believer or nonbeliever to realize the lack of control over his/her life. However the use of spiritual coping strategies may enhance self-empowerment, leading to finding meaning and purpose in illness. This implies that holistic care incorporates facilitation of various spiritual coping strategies to safeguard the wholeness and integrity of the patients.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af2b6faa1c924c0de5087ba8d025f6d4fdfed625,af2b6faa1c924c0de5087ba8d025f6d4fdfed625

"Organizational Citizenship: A Review, Proposed Model, and Research Agenda",Mel E. Schnake,"Organizational citizenship was recently proposed as a form of job performance which may be more strongly related to job satisfaction than performance measures employed in previous job satisfaction-job performance research. However organizational citizenship holds more promise for organizational behavior research than merely its relationship to job satisfaction. Organ (1988a) argues that organizational citizenship, in the aggregate, promotes the effective functioning of the organization. Citizenship is defined as ""supra-role behavior,"" that is, behavior which goes beyond formal job descriptions but which is desired by an organization (Organ, 1988a). Examples include helping co-workers who fall behind in task performance, keeping a work area clean, accepting temporary assignments without complaint, volunteering for tasks that are not assigned, and making suggestions which will improve the department (Bateman & Organ, 1983; Smith, Organ & Near, 1983).

Some papers reported purposive attempts to innovate with, and to adapt, methods for synthesis. Many papers lack explicitness about methods for searching, appraisal, and synthesis, and there is little evidence of emerging consensus on many issues. There was also some evidence of possibly inappropriate use of some techniques.

Research Paper: Who Uses the Patient Internet Portal? The PatientSite Experience,"S. Weingart, D. Rind, Zachary Tofias, D. Z. Sands","OBJECTIVE
Although the patient Internet portal is a potentially transformative technology, there is little scientific information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of portal enrollees and the features that they access.


DESIGN
We describe two pilot studies of a comprehensive Internet portal called PatientSite. These pilots include a prospective one-year cohort study of all patients who enrolled in April 2003 and a case-control study in 2004 of enrollees and nonenrollees at two hospital-based primary care practices.


MEASUREMENTS
The cohort study tracked patient enrollment and features in PatientSite that enrollees accessed, such as laboratory and radiology results, prescription renewals, appointment requests, managed care referrals, and clinical messaging. The case-control study used medical record review to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of 100 randomly selected PatientSite enrollees and 100 nonenrollees.


RESULTS
PatientSite use grew steadily after its introduction. New enrollees logged in most frequently in the first month, but 26% to 77% of the cohort continued to access the portal at least monthly. They most often examined laboratory and radiology results and sent clinical messages to their providers. PatientSite enrollees were younger and more affluent and had fewer medical problems than nonenrollees.


CONCLUSION
Expanding the use of patient portals will require an understanding of obstacles that prevent access for those who might benefit most from this technology.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3290edde77d7144e0d526742279e2a9e687efcf,b3290edde77d7144e0d526742279e2a9e687efcf

"Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP) or Self-Determination Applied to Research: A Critical Analysis of Contemporary First Nations Research and Some Options for First Nations Communities",B. Schnarch,"The principles of ownership, control, access and possession (OCAP) crystallize themes long advocated by First Nations in Canada. Coined by the Steering Committee of the First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey, the principles are discussed as an expression of self-determination in research. The key notions outlined in this paper relate to the collective ownership of group information; First Nations control over research and information; First Nations’ management of access to their data and physical possession of the data. Following a critical review of colonial research practices and recent institutional efforts to improve ethics in Aboriginal research, this paper highlights policies and strategies adopted by First Nations organizations – approaches which offer a way out of the muddle of contemporary Aboriginal research and the ethical dilemmas that characterize it. The benefits of OCAP are described including the rebuilding of trust, improved research quality and relevance, decreased bias, meaningful capacity development, and community empowerment to make change.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3427d6ad229e3eb1ac1267c8d835ed64221b42cc,3427d6ad229e3eb1ac1267c8d835ed64221b42cc
Review and Critical Assessment of Research on Marketing and the Environment,"W. Kilbourne, S. Beckmann","This paper provides a review and categorization of the environmentally related research published in the major English language marketing journals over the period from 1971 to 1997. It traces the development from the early research which focused predominantly on the characterization of the ""green"" consumer, conceptualization of environmental consciousness, environmentally related behaviours such as recycling, and attitudes towards environmental problems such as pollution. This was followed by a period in which energy conservation, legislation, and public policy issues were added to the agenda which remained predominantly managerialist in perspective. While the same issues were studied within the 1990s, the research agenda was expanded again to include broader issues such as environmental values and institutions. Most recently, the macro issues of sustainable marketing and its relationship to the dominant social paradigm have been introduced into the literature.

Applying extinction research and theory to cue-exposure addiction treatments.,"C. Conklin, S. Tiffany","AIMS
To evaluate the efficacy of cue-exposure addiction treatment and review modern animal learning research to generate recommendations for substantially enhancing the effectiveness of this treatment.


DESIGN
Meta-analysis of cue-exposure addiction treatment outcome studies (N=9), review of animal extinction research and theory, and evaluation of whether major principles from this literature are addressed adequately in cue-exposure treatments.


FINDINGS
The meta-analytical review showed that there is no consistent evidence for the efficacy of cue-exposure treatment as currently implemented. Moreover, procedures derived from the animal learning literature that should maximize the potential of extinction training are rarely used in cue-exposure treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
Given what is known from animal extinction theory and research about extinguishing learned behavior, it is not surprising that cue-exposure treatments so often fail. This paper reviews current animal research regarding the most salient threats to the development and maintenance of extinction, and suggests several major procedures for increasing the efficacy of cue-exposure addiction treatment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29712c94993e7d3e08a766fe87c77302a80c16e5,29712c94993e7d3e08a766fe87c77302a80c16e5

Delirium Superimposed on Dementia: A Systematic Review,"D. Fick, Joseph V. Agostini, S. Inouye","Delirium in a patient with preexisting dementia is a common problem that may have serious complications and poor prognostic implications. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of the medical literature on delirium superimposed on dementia, specifically to review studies on prevalence, associated features, outcomes, and management. Areas of controversy and gaps in our knowledge of this problem are highlighted. Finally, an agenda for future research is proposed. Fourteen studies were reviewed, including seven prospective studies, three retrospective studies, two cross‐sectional studies, and two clinical trials. For the review of the literature on delirium superimposed on dementia, we searched MEDLINE from January 1966 through February 2002 for research studies with primary sources of data. Selection criteria for inclusion of articles in this study were inclusion of data on subjects with delirium superimposed on dementia, inclusion of a validated operational definition/measures of dementia and delirium, actual data on persons with delirium and dementia reported in the paper, and reporting of primary data. MEDLINE was searched using the following key search terms: delirium, acute confusion, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, delirium superimposed on dementia, and elderly. The prevalence of delirium superimposed on dementia ranged from 22% to 89% of hospitalized and community populations aged 65 and older with dementia. To date, only one reported study systematically identified associated factors and interventions for delirium superimposed on dementia, but several studies examining outcomes have found that adverse events are associated with delirium in persons with dementia, including accelerated and long‐term cognitive and functional decline, need for institutionalization, rehospitalization, and increased mortality. This paper highlights the dearth of research on delirium superimposed on dementia and stresses the importance of early recognition and prevention of delirium in persons with dementia.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7df38d43ccb02fce7a100168dad893020cea9e19,7df38d43ccb02fce7a100168dad893020cea9e19

THE PROBLEM OF UNOBSERVABLES IN STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH,"Paul C. Godfrey, C. Hill","In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic marmgement literature—including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best part of the current century. On the one hand, there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26b0dbaaa3a293b01668f57997e811f35fc52bf3,26b0dbaaa3a293b01668f57997e811f35fc52bf3

Humphrey,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the contribution made by auditing research over the last three decades to understandings of audit practice and to consider the implications for the future development of the discipline. Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a literature review. Findings - The paper challenges the extent of one's knowledge of audit practice, highlighting a variety of concerns with dominant research approaches/traditions and pin-pointing a range of research questions and approaches which offer potentially rewarding insights of the audit practice arena. Practical implications - The paper emphasises the scope for auditing researchers and practitioners to think differently about audit practice and to work collectively in pursuing advances in auditing knowledge and educational processes more generally. Originality/value - The paper illustrates just how vibrant contemporary auditing research agendas can be when the focus is directly on understanding the practice of audit and the work of associated regulatory institutions.

Interviewee Transcript Review: assessing the impact on qualitative research,"Victoria Hagens, Mark J Dobrow, Roger Chafe","BackgroundThis paper assesses interviewee transcript review (ITR) as a technique for improving the rigour of interview-based, qualitative research. ITR is a process whereby interviewees are provided with verbatim transcripts of their interviews for the purposes of verifying accuracy, correcting errors or inaccuracies and providing clarifications. ITR, in various forms, is widely used among qualitative researchers, however there is limited methodological guidance on how it should be employed and little is known about its actual impact on the transcript, the data, the interviewee or the researcher.MethodsITR was incorporated into a qualitative research study in which 51 key informant interviews were conducted with a range of senior stakeholders within the Canadian health care system. The changes made by interviewees to their transcripts were systematically tracked and categorized using a set of mutually exclusive categories.ResultsThe study found that ITR added little to the accuracy of the transcript and may create complications if the goal of the researcher is to produce a transcript which reflects precisely what was said at the time of the interview. The advantages of ITR are that it allows interviewees the opportunity to edit or clarify information provided in the original interview, with many interviewees providing corrections, clarifications, and in some cases, adding new material to their transcripts. There are also potential disadvantages, such as a bias created by inconsistent data sources or the loss of data when an interviewee chooses to remove valuable material. The impact of ITR on the interviewee may be both positive and negative, depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the study. The impact of ITR on the researcher was minimal in this study, but is again subject to specific circumstances of the research context.ConclusionWhile ITR is employed by many researchers across numerous fields, the advantages of its use may be relatively small in terms of verifying the accuracy of qualitative interview transcripts. Researchers are advised to carefully consider both the potential advantages and disadvantages of ITR outlined in this paper before deciding to incorporate the practice within their qualitative study designs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea1f2505e61222ae4f84eb5bb48f6fe87d718f0b,ea1f2505e61222ae4f84eb5bb48f6fe87d718f0b

Research Paper: Technology Implementation and Workarounds in the Nursing Home,"A. Vogelsmeier, J. Halbesleben, Jill R. Scott-Cawiezell","OBJECTIVE
This study sought to explore the relationship of workarounds related to the implementation of an electronic medication administration record and medication safety practices in five Midwestern nursing homes.


DESIGN
As a part of a larger study, this qualitative evaluation was conducted to identify workarounds associated with the implementation of an electronic medication administration record. Data were collected using multimethods including direct observation, process mapping, key informant interviews, and review of field notes from medication safety team meetings.


MEASUREMENTS
Open and axial coding techniques were used to identify and categorize types of workarounds in relation to work flow blocks.


RESULTS
Workarounds presented in two distinct patterns, those related to work flow blocks introduced by technology and those related to organizational processes not reengineered to effectively integrate with the technology. Workarounds such as safety alert overrides and shortcuts to documentation resulted from first-order problem solving of immediate blocks. Nursing home staff as individuals frequently used first-order problem solving instead of the more sophisticated second-order problem solving approach used by the medication safety team.


CONCLUSION
This study provides important practical examples of how nursing home staff work around work flow blocks encountered during the implementation of technology. Understanding these workarounds as a means of first-order problem solving is an important consideration to understanding risk to medication safety.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cdbc3d915e104d7515c352a67cf159a5c70803f,7cdbc3d915e104d7515c352a67cf159a5c70803f
"Strategic Groups: Theory, Research and Taxonomy","J. McGee, H. Thomas","This paper discusses the concept of strategic groups, focusing upon the importance of intra-industry strategic groupings in understanding differences across firms within an industry. The problems involved in identifying strategic groups within industries are examined through a comprehensive review of recent studies. It is demonstrated that much of the research has used surrogates for elements of a firm's strategic direction, e.g. vertical integration, product range, R & D expenditure, to suggest bases by which creative and sustainable groups are formed. The authors argue that certain theoretical concepts such as mobility barriers, isolating mechanisms and controllable variablesprovide much firmer bases for identifying strategic groups within industries. Thus, taxonomies for understanding the nature of strategic group formulation can be developed. Implications of the strategic group concept for such strategic issues as the structure-performance linkage, firm mobility, patterns of rivalry, industry evolutionand firm growthare then examined.

The development and the main results of classical scheduling theory are reviewed and presented in an easily accessible way. Recent trends in scheduling research which attempt to make it more relevant and applicable are described. The nature of the gap between theory and practice is discussed. The failure of classical scheduling theory to address the total environment within which the scheduling function operates is noted. However, scheduling research in operations management and manufacturing systems tends to ignore the rich vein of methods, techniques and results in the classical theory.

Time for Revival? Public policy implementation: a review of the literature and an agenda for future research,J. Schofield,"This paper argues that there is not a vigorous contemporary literature in the UK which addresses implementation studies as part of the public policy process, whereas this is not the case in the USA. A review of the literature is presented, and a critique of the more traditional thematic groupings used to review the literature is given. A revised thematic review of the literature is presented based on the four themes of: (1) the role of knowledge and learning in policy implementation; (2) the processes of policy implementation; (3) the role of actors and agents in implementation; and (4) the role of bureaucratic discretion. The paper argues for a revival of research into public policy implementation and suggests a research agenda for the future which can use the aforementioned themes from the literature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/727dd7592f451ec0912ff8698838c4a80b4b747c,727dd7592f451ec0912ff8698838c4a80b4b747c
The impacts of sharing production information on supply chain dynamics: A review of the literature,"G. Huang, J. Lau, K. Mak","This paper is a review of research into the impacts of sharing production information on the supply chain dynamics. The purpose of the review is to understand the needs to unravel such impacts on the supply chain design and management, to identify the current research frontier and to study the future trend in this field. The scope of the review is somewhat broad in the sense that more than 100 relevant publications resulting from major research projects and originating from some leading research groups are selected for review. In order to maintain the necessary coherence and consistency, this comprehensive review proposes a loose reference framework to reflect major elements commonly involved in this type of research, including the decision level investigated, supply chain structure, research questions addressed, factors involved, supply chain dynamics measured, modelling methodology adopted, data analysis technique used, and findings and insights from the managerial perspective obtained. The framework serves as a skeleton for categorizing literature and research areas into these key elements. It is hoped that this review is valuable and beneficial both to new researchers entering the field, in order to gain their interest, references and focus, and to experienced researchers, in order, perhaps, to identify new research opportunities and/or issues that intersect these researchers' past and current interests.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80e2be606ea46270273d04e0fc9556abec70a370,80e2be606ea46270273d04e0fc9556abec70a370
"Representation, Legitimation, and Autoethnography: An Autoethnographic Writing Story",N. Holt,"The purpose of this article is to critique representation and legitimation as they relate to the peer review process for an autoethnographic manuscript. Using a conversation derived from seven reviewers' comments pertaining to one autoethnographic manuscript, issues relating to (a) the use of verification strategies in autoethnographic studies; and, (b) the use of self as the only data source are discussed. As such, this paper can be considered as an autoethnographic writing story. The problematic nature of autoethnography, which is located at the boundaries of scientific research, is examined by linking the author's experiences of the review process with dominant research perspectives. Suggestions for investigators wishing to produce autoethnographic accounts are outlined along with a call for the development of appropriate evaluative criteria for such work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d337b29d99f5581d755acea2624df666198e2c95,d337b29d99f5581d755acea2624df666198e2c95

Public Sector to Public Services: 20 Years of 'Contextual' Accounting Research,"J. Broadbent, J. Guthrie","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and critique the field of public sector accounting research. Many nation states deliver essential public services. In recent times, many of these nations have been involved in programmes of “modernisation”, which, in part, means that these public services now are significantly managed, delivered and governed by private and third sector organisations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs a literature-based analysis and critique of public sector accounting articles published in the selected journals from 1992 to 2006. From this, a descriptive meta-analysis of the characteristics of the research will be discussed. Finally, a conceptual analysis of the selected literature will be used to evaluate the field and address a possible future research agenda. Findings - The descriptive analysis highlights that among the research papers reviewed several interesting patterns emerged concerning public service research. Also, the dominance of Australasia and UK research was noted. The extent of research in different levels of government/jurisdiction indicated that the majority of research was organisationally based. Finally, when the various functional types of accounting are considered, management accounting remained the most researched area of interest. Research limitations/implications - The paper only considered research within eight selected journals and over the period 1992 to 2006. Therefore, for instance, US mainstream public sector accounting research has not been reviewed. Originality/value - The main implications of the paper are that “contextual” public service accounting research has a strong tradition and, through the process of reflection and critique of the body of work, several important insights are provided in order to highlight areas for further research and policy development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f52ac3338b574c7f9e8373a0dff1536789a2e998,f52ac3338b574c7f9e8373a0dff1536789a2e998

Reviewing Reviews of Research in Educational Leadership,Philip Hallinger,"Purpose: Reviews of research play a critical but underappreciated role in knowledge production and accumulation. Yet, until relatively recently, limited attention has been given to the “methodology” of conducting reviews of research. This observation also applies in educational leadership and management where reviews of research have charted intellectual progress since the field’s inception in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper was framed as a “methodological review of reviews of research” in educational leadership and management. Method: The author analyzed 38 reviews of research in educational leadership published in nine international refereed journals over the past 52 years. The author applies a conceptual framework and analytical rubric for conducting systematic reviews of research in analyzing this sample of research reviews. Data analysis focuses on describing methodological characteristics, illuminating patterns of strength and weakness in review methods, and identifying a set of exemplary reviews. Findings: Despite publication of a number of “exemplary reviews,” there remains considerable room for improvement in the methodology of conducting systematic reviews of research in educational leadership and management. The study identified a tendency for research reviews in this field to omit key information concerning the rationale and nature of the studies included in the reviews, methods of data collection, extraction, evaluation and analysis, and how these choices impacted interpretation of the findings. Implications: This comprehensive set of 38 published review articles tracks the historical development of the field and, by itself, represents a rich harvest from the study. Within this historical corpus of reviews, the study identified a subset of “exemplary reviews” that can serve as useful models for future scholarship. Finally, by identifying patterns of methodological strength and weakness among the reviews as a group, the report offers empirically grounded recommendations for strengthening future reviews of research in educational leadership and management.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a052d810e40900faf758b38589b124eb46d0d15,6a052d810e40900faf758b38589b124eb46d0d15
Neurobiological Correlates of Autism: A Review of Recent Research,H. Penn,"This review paper integrates recent structural and functional imaging, postmortem, animal lesion, and neurochemical research about the pathophysiology of autism. An understanding of the neurobiological correlates of autism is becoming increasingly important as more children are diagnosed with the condition and funding for well-targeted interventions increases. Converging evidence suggests that autism involves abnormalities in brain volume, neurotransmitter systems, and neuronal growth. In addition, evidence firmly links autism with abnormalities in the cerebellum, the medial temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe.

Thus, it is common to find in the open literature references that point out the highly subjective results derived from such studies (often of somewhat contradictory nature). This paper tries to compile the main conclusions that ISO 9001 research studies have tried to address, with the aim of describing the quality management systems literature state‐of‐the‐art.Design/methodology/approach – In order to achieve this objective, an exhaustive literature review of ISO 9000 studies was carried out.

Methodology Review: Clustering Methods,"G. W. Milligan, M. Cooper","A review of clustering methodology is presented, with emphasis on algorithm performance and the re sulting implications for applied research. After an over view of the clustering literature, the clustering process is discussed within a seven-step framework. The four major types of clustering methods can be characterized as hierarchical, partitioning, overlapping, and ordina tion algorithms. The validation of such algorithms re fers to the problem of determining the ability of the methods to recover cluster configurations which are known to exist in the data. Validation approaches in clude mathematical derivations, analyses of empirical datasets, and monte carlo simulation methods. Next, interpretation and inference procedures in cluster anal ysis are discussed. inference procedures involve test ing for significant cluster structure and the problem of determining the number of clusters in the data. The paper concludes with two sets of recommendations. One set deals with topics in clustering that would ben efit from continued research into the methodology.

L2 Word Recognition Research: A Critical Review.,K. Koda,"The major purpose of this paper is to explore conceptual syntheses that advance second language (L2) word recognition research and, in so doing, uncover new agendas relating to cross-linguistic examinations of L2 processing. The paper first describes connections between word recognition and reading and the specific ways in which efficient word recognition contributes to comprehension performance. It then provides a brief overview of the connectionist construct and an expanded consideration of word recognition skills development from this vantage point. Further, it illustrates cross-linguistic variations in word recognition processes by comparing and contrasting response patterns among readers in different orthographic systems.

Methodological issues for population‐based research into dementia in developing countries. A position paper from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group,M. Prince,"The 10/66 Dementia Research Group has been formed to promote good‐quality, internationally comparable research into dementia in developing countries through active research collaboration. In this position paper, we review existing research into dementia prevalence in developing regions of the world. Seven methodologically robust studies were identified. The prevalence of dementia, age‐adjusted to the age structure of the Kerala population, ranged from 1.3% to 5.3% for all those aged 60 or over and from 1.7% to 5.2% for all those aged 65 and over. Two studies, from Ibadan, Nigeria and Ballabgarh, India, reported strikingly low prevalence figures. The reported prevalence for most studies was somewhat lower than the consistent figures for Europe reported by the EURODEM concerted action. Based on critical review of the literature, and on the practical research experience of members of the 10/66 group, recommendations have been made for procedure in the following areas: age limits for inclusion in dementia surveys, age ascertainment, sampling, scope for incidence studies, functional assessment and culture‐ and education‐fair dementia diagnosis.

Internationalization as a strategy process,L. Melin,"This paper critically reviews the field of international business research. The field is characterized by considerable intellectual diversity, where theoretical focus is blurred by the multidisciplinary nature of the field. The review focuses on three themes that help shed light on internationalization as a strategy process; stage models of internationalization, studies of the link between strategy and structure in MNCs, and studies of administrative processes in MNCs and recent organizational models for MNCs. Sequential stages models are too deterministic and stress only early stages of internationalization. Conceptual contributions from research on structures following strategies have a very static character. Research on management processes in MNCs have a questionable empirical base and normative bent. Three key themes for future research on internationalization as a process are suggested. These themes, dealing with major omissions and weaknesses identified in the review, are: the study of acquisition processes and internationalization, the study of dynamic processes in MNCs, and the study of internationalization processes in their outer contexts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cd5702a0fd49586fdbcd3b39853a49cd1c2d7e6,7cd5702a0fd49586fdbcd3b39853a49cd1c2d7e6

"Understanding the volunteer market: the what, where, who and why of volunteering","H. Bussell, D. Forbes","Although the work of the voluntary sector is growing, the number of people volunteering is not increasing at a comparable rate. This paper argues that the key to an organisation's success in recruiting and retaining its volunteers is to have an understanding of its target group. As a means to developing this understanding the paper reviews the prior research on volunteering and outlines the current situation in the voluntary sector with regard to the donation of time. The review shows that those who volunteer are an extremely diverse group, active in a wide variety of contexts. This makes the definition of a volunteer a more complex task than one would expect. It also demonstrates that individuals and organisations may volunteer for reasons other than purely altruistic motives. Finally, the paper identifies gaps in this area of research and presents topics for further research.

This paper presents worked examples of two methods of data synthesis (textual narrative and thematic), used in relation to one review, with the aim of enabling researchers to consider the strength of different approaches.MethodsA systematic review of lay perspectives of infant size and growth was conducted, locating 19 studies (including both qualitative and quantitative). The data extracted from these were synthesised using both a textual narrative and a thematic synthesis.ResultsThe processes of both methods are presented, showing a stepwise progression to the final synthesis. Both methods led us to similar conclusions about lay views toward infant size and growth. Differences between methods lie in the way they dealt with study quality and heterogeneity.ConclusionOn the basis of the work reported here, we consider textual narrative and thematic synthesis have strengths and weaknesses in relation to different research questions. Thematic synthesis holds most potential for hypothesis generation, but may obscure heterogeneity and quality appraisal. Textual narrative synthesis is better able to describe the scope of existing research and account for the strength of evidence, but is less good at identifying commonality.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/822776de2f0c2116b091d10ac74a926515bc85cc,822776de2f0c2116b091d10ac74a926515bc85cc

Research Paper: Auditing the Unified Medical Language System with Semantic Methods,J. Cimino,"OBJECTIVE
The National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) includes a Metathesaurus (Meta), which is a compilation of medical terms drawn from over 30 controlled vocabularies, and a Semantic Net, which contains the semantic types used to categorize Meta concepts and the semantic relations to connect them. Meta has been constructed through lexical matching techniques and human review. The purpose of this study was to audit the Meta using semantic techniques to identify possible inconsistencies.


METHODS
Five different techniques were applied: (1) detection of ambiguity in Meta concepts with two or more semantic types, (2) detection of interchangeable keyword synonyms, (3) detection of redundant pairs of Meta concepts (using lexical matching combined with keyword synonyms), (4) detection of inconsistent parent-child relationships in Meta (based on the semantic type information), and (5) discovery of pairs of semantic types for which relations could be added to the Semantic Net, based on ""other"" relationships between Meta concepts.


RESULTS
Of 57,592 concepts with multiple semantic types, 1817 (3.2%) were judged to be ambiguous. Keyword analysis showed 7121 pairs of interchangeable words. Using the keyword pairs, 5031 pairs of potentially redundant concepts were suggested, of which 3274 (65.1%) were judged to actually be redundant. Review of the 100,586 parent-child relationships revealed 544 (0.54%) that were incorrect. Review of the 219,664 ""Other"" relationships suggested 1299 places in the Semantic Net where relations between pairs of semantic types could be added.


CONCLUSION
Semantic techniques, alone or in combination, can be used to audit the UMLS to detect inconsistencies that are not detectable through lexical techniques alone. Use of these methods to augment the UMLS maintenance process will lead to improvement in the UMLS.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ddf3716a827afeff96a417ff5c9d927ccdb3a32,9ddf3716a827afeff96a417ff5c9d927ccdb3a32

Grounded theory research: literature reviewing and reflexivity.,"G. McGhee, G. Marland, J. Atkinson","AIM
This paper is a report of a discussion of the arguments surrounding the role of the initial literature review in grounded theory.


BACKGROUND
Researchers new to grounded theory may find themselves confused about the literature review, something we ourselves experienced, pointing to the need for clarity about use of the literature in grounded theory to help guide others about to embark on similar research journeys.


DISCUSSION
The arguments for and against the use of a substantial topic-related initial literature review in a grounded theory study are discussed, giving examples from our own studies. The use of theoretically sampled literature and the necessity for reflexivity are also discussed. Reflexivity is viewed as the explicit quest to limit researcher effects on the data by awareness of self, something seen as integral both to the process of data collection and the constant comparison method essential to grounded theory.


CONCLUSION
A researcher who is close to the field may already be theoretically sensitized and familiar with the literature on the study topic. Use of literature or any other preknowledge should not prevent a grounded theory arising from the inductive-deductive interplay which is at the heart of this method. Reflexivity is needed to prevent prior knowledge distorting the researcher's perceptions of the data.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76ac78ccdf750c45b0e54604ea38843f27159853,76ac78ccdf750c45b0e54604ea38843f27159853
Coopetition: An Introduction to the Subject and an Agenda for Research,K. Walley,"The traditional view of inter-firm dynamics suggests that relationships are either competitive or cooperative in nature. However, it is apparent that in practice, firms can compete and cooperate with each other at the same time. The term used to refer to a relationship between two firms that simultaneously involves both competition and cooperation is ""coopetition."" Although there is evidence to suggest that organizations have been involved in coopetitive relationships for some considerable time, it is only relatively recently that the subject has found increased favor in the academic literature. It would appear, however, that the literature concerning coopetition is still limited in scope, and in order to address the issue, this paper presents an agenda for researchers interested in the subject of coopetition. The agenda is generated by reconciling a review of the literature on coopetition with a similar review of the literature relating to competition and cooperation. The agenda also incorporates two innovative ideas based on anecdotal evidence and personal observations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/749654c8c97331e151cc75dc0cf25eb5a5395b5c,749654c8c97331e151cc75dc0cf25eb5a5395b5c

Stress and the higher education student: a critical review of the literature,"David Robotham, C. Julian","The available research indicates that the prevalence of stress is increasing among students studying in higher education. Issues such as student retention and student progression are becoming increasingly important for all universities. There are a significant number of studies that have examined stress and this paper critically reviews that research and identifies several issues that as yet have not been explored. The paper also highlights a number of key weaknesses in the current literature base.

Strengthening the Financial Reporting System: Can Audit Committees Deliver?,"J. Bedard, Y. Gendron","This paper reviews the literature on audit committees in order to evaluate the extent to which committees are effective in terms of strengthening financial reporting. The paper aims to achieve two goals: first. to provide updated information about the effectiveness of the audit committee, and second to identify research opportunities. Compared with other reviews on the matter, we cover a broader spectrum of theoretical perspectives from various fields, methods, and countries. In particular, our review investigates from a meta-perspective the results reported in studies which examine the relationship between certain audit committee characteristics and measures of audit committee effectiveness. It is hoped that this work will sensitize accounting researchers about the appropriateness of extending the boundaries of research on audit committees, from methodological, theoretical, and geographical points of view.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71229486edb61824e35fd305c01fae7de3e54ddf,71229486edb61824e35fd305c01fae7de3e54ddf

The Common Optimization INterface for Operations Research: Promoting open-source software in the operations research community,Robert W. Lougee,"The Common Optimization INterface for Operations Research (COIN-OR, http://www.coin-or.org/) is an initiative to promote open-source software for the operations research (OR) community. In OR practice and research, software is fundamental. The dependence of OR on software implies that the ways in which software is developed, managed, and distributed can have a significant impact on the field. Open source is a relatively new software development and distribution model which offers advantages over current practices. Its viability depends on the precise definition of open source, on the culture of a distributed developer community, and on a version-control system which makes distributed development possible. In this paper, we review open-source philosophy and culture, and present the goals and status of COIN-OR.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f725c1925bbc7f73b5eb7907980a807a96b922e,2f725c1925bbc7f73b5eb7907980a807a96b922e

Organizational Identification: A Conceptual and Operational Review,M. Edwards,"There is a growing body of literature presenting the argument that processes of organizational identification (OI) are extremely important in helping to ensure that staff work towards the interests of the organization. There are, however, a number of problems with the way that the notion of OI has been conceptualized and operationalized in the extant literature. This paper examines how OI has been defined and measured over a number of decades. A number of problems are identified with how OI has been conceptualized by researchers, including, for example, issues about whether there is an affective element to identification and how the construct relates to organizational commitment. The paper also includes a review of previous approaches to measuring the concept of OI and raises some key problems with existing research tools. The paper concludes by arguing for a particular conceptualization of OI which helps to clarify the complex relationship between identification and organizational commitment, while at the same time accommodating previous definitions of the construct.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bac48b86fd9d45317a9612dce0d8ad08c23d05e1,bac48b86fd9d45317a9612dce0d8ad08c23d05e1

The Aims and Process of the Research Paper,"R. Schwegler, Linda K. Shamoon","Many members of our department-and yours too, we suspect-have stopped teaching the research paper in composition courses because the papers they receive are so often disappointing and because they believe that freshmen and sophomores may not be sophisticated enough to do the kind of thinking necessary for a worthwhile research paper. These instructors say they view the research paper not simply as a review of information found in secondary sources, but as an argument with sources which expands the student's (and the reader's) view of the subject. But, they complain, students seem overwhelmed by what they find in outside sources and are incapable of weaving the information they have gathered into an argument that presents and defends their point of view. Composition textbooks and writing teachers have tried to deal with this problem in three ways, each of which has proven inadequate in some respect. One answer has been to provide better training in gathering and arranging information (that is, library and documentation skills). Though these skills have some value, they still are likely to have little impact on the quality of the papers students write in composition courses or in other courses because academic research is a process of inquiry, problem-solving, and argument, not simply an information-gathering process. A second answer has been to place considerable stress on the argumentative nature of the research paper. But though academic research papers contain arguments, they cannot be called argumentative in aim or structure because they do not focus on altering the values, ideas, or emotional attitudes of an audience or on moving the audience to action of some kind: intellectual, emotional, or physical. The kind of research papers scholars write and reward their students",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82f5eab231e03beb507c22f7b5d2c8754c6937b3,82f5eab231e03beb507c22f7b5d2c8754c6937b3

The physics of paper,"M. Alava, K. Niskanen","Paper is a material known to everybody. It has a network structure consisting of wood fibres that can be mimicked by cooking a portion of spaghetti and pouring it on a plate, to form a planar assembly of fibres that lie roughly horizontal. Real paper also contains other constituents added for technical purposes. This review has two main lines of thought. First, in the introductory part, we consider the physics that one encounters when ‘using’ paper, an everyday material that exhibits the presence of disorder. Questions arise, for instance, as to why some papers are opaque and others translucent, some are sturdy and others sloppy, some readily absorb drops of liquid while others resist the penetration of water. The mechanical and rheological properties of paper and paperboard are also interesting. They are inherently dependent on moisture content. In humid conditions paper is ductile and soft, in dry conditions brittle and hard. In the second part we explain in more detail research problems concerned with paper. We start with paper structure. Paper is made by dewatering a suspension of fibres starting from very low content of solids. The processes of aggregation, sedimentation and clustering are familiar from statistical mechanics. Statistical growth models or packing models can simulate paper formation well and teach a lot about its structure. The second research area that we consider is the elastic and viscoelastic properties and fracture of paper and paperboard. This has traditionally been the strongest area of paper physics. There are many similarities to, but also important differences from, composite materials. Paper has proved to be convenient test material for new theories in statistical fracture mechanics. Polymer physics and memory effects are encountered when studying creep and stress relaxation in paper. Water is a ‘softener’ of paper. In humid conditions, the creep rate of paper is much higher than in dry conditions. The third among our topics is the interaction of paper with water. The penetration of water into paper is an interesting transport problem because wood fibres are hygroscopic and swell with water intake. The porous fibre network medium changes as the water first penetrates into the pore space between the fibres and then into the fibres. This is an area where relatively little systematic research has been done. Finally, we summarize our thoughts on paper physics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84cbb3b315360f9756497ed977f734727cd4c710,84cbb3b315360f9756497ed977f734727cd4c710

BACKGROUND
Spiritual care of patients/clients is expected of nurses and is reflected in nursing codes of ethics, nurse education guidelines, policy documents and nursing guidance. Recent years have seen a proliferation in nursing research in this area, particularly in the UK and North America, and now in other European countries. It seemed timely, therefore, to review this published research.


METHOD
Included in the review were 47 original published nursing research papers identified from a CINAHL search and from a collection held by the author since 1983. Papers were sorted into five categories, a template to aid reviewing was produced and a short summary and critique of each paper was written.


CONCLUSIONS
Research on spirituality and health needs to move forward in a systematic and co-ordinated way.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Hopefully, the research summarized in this paper will be useful to clinicians and nurse educators as they strive to incorporate spiritual care within their practice. In turn patients/clients and their families should benefit from care which is more holistic and addresses their deepest concerns and needs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/caec7f67adfecde213a6f2589ab47263c7187e0b,caec7f67adfecde213a6f2589ab47263c7187e0b
Current research on profile monitoring,W. Woodall,"In many applications the quality of a process or product is best characterized and summarized by a functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Profile monitoring is used to understand and to check the stability of this relationship over time. At each sampling stage one observes a collection of data points that can be represented by a curve (or profile). In some calibration applications, the profile can be represented adequately by a simple linear regression model, while in other applications more complicated models are needed. The purposes of this paper are to review recent research on the use of control charts to monitor process and product quality profiles and to encourage further research in this area.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6140862a78bcfc833aad7450b506d47a1d21f45d,6140862a78bcfc833aad7450b506d47a1d21f45d

A review and classification of heuristics for permutation flow-shop scheduling with makespan objective,"J. Framiñan, J. Gupta, R. Leisten","Makespan minimization in permutation flow-shop scheduling is an operations research topic that has been intensively addressed during the last 40 years. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard for more than two machines, most of the research effort has been devoted to the development of heuristic procedures in order to provide good approximate solutions to the problem. However, little attention has been devoted to establish a common framework for these heuristics so that they can be effectively combined or extended.

The Delphi method and health research,J. Meyrick,"The Delphi method is well suited to the research needed to inform health education and health promotion campaigns. This paper measures the current interest in the method by way of a literature review. It then describes how the method has evolved from its inception in the 1950s, to its current form. The focus is on a Delphi variant that is particularly relevant to health education – the Policy Delphi. The benefits of the method for the developer of health education and health promotion campaigns are then discussed. The main benefits relate to the gaining of expert opinions without the time and geographical restraints involved in alternative methods. The anonymity that is central to the Delphi method also has benefits for the researcher. The last section of the paper deals with potential pitfalls in the Delphi method that might undermine the successful application of the method, and recommends steps the practitioner can take to address these pitfalls.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cebfe376d92f6fb89b8f90bbc2a1792dcf58ea8,8cebfe376d92f6fb89b8f90bbc2a1792dcf58ea8

Leisure constraints∗: A survey of past research,E. L. Jackson,"Abstract This paper provides a brief review of past research on leisure constraints, paying particular attention to conceptual and analytical issues and to the practical applications of investigating constraints on leisure behavior. Specific findings are not reviewed; the intention is to clarify concepts by focusing upon broadly‐defined methodological aspects of past research. These include the nature and role of constraints on leisure participation, the distinction between barriers and reasons (e.g., for non‐participation), and empirical and conceptual methods of classifying constraints. It is suggested that future investigations of leisure constraints will give rise to findings that can be generalized across time, space, and social groups only if they are based upon clearly‐defined and standardized concepts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0051e14162adc7a0cbd7cdb20e705afc7e7732c,d0051e14162adc7a0cbd7cdb20e705afc7e7732c

BUILDING THE STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY: SOME CONSIDERATIONS FROM EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,K. Taber,"This paper sets out to consider how educational research into the learning of structural aspects of chemistry might inform teaching practice. The paper is based around a review of research findings into learners’ difficulties in developing the scientific models of chemical structures (atoms, molecules, lattices etc.) This forms the second of the four sections into which the paper is organised. The paper begins by considering how ideas about the learning process can inform our understanding of alternative conceptions and frameworks in chemistry, and - therefore - how we should view the research reviewed in the second section. This is a consideration of the findings of studies into difficulties learning about the molecular model; atomic structure; molecular structure; and lattices. This review is followed by a section identifying some key ‘pedagogic impediments’ - alternative aspects of learners’ thinking that seem to derive from the way the subject is taught. In the final section some practical suggestions are made regarding how the teaching of chemistry may be revised to help learners construct the scientific models rather than develop the alternative conceptions.

The Effectiveness of Software Development Technical Reviews: A Behaviorally Motivated Program of Research,"Chris Sauer, D. R. Jeffery, L. Land, P. Yetton","Software engineers use a number of different types of software development technical review (SDTR) for the purpose of detecting defects in software products. This paper applies the behavioral theory of group performance to explain the outcomes of software reviews. A program of empirical research is developed, including propositions to both explain review performance and identify ways of improving review performance based on the specific strengths of individuals and groups. Its contributions are to clarify our understanding of what drives defect detection performance in SDTRs and to set an agenda for future research. In identifying individuals' task expertise as the primary driver of review performance, the research program suggests specific points of leverage for substantially improving review performance. It points to the importance of understanding software reading expertise and implies the need for a reconsideration of existing approaches to managing reviews.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b7008622426b6100c344efff4a76832e7d47400,5b7008622426b6100c344efff4a76832e7d47400

Internalized homophobia and health issues affecting lesbians and gay men.,Iain Williamson,"This paper investigates the concept of internalized homophobia in both theory and research relating to lesbian and gay health. It offers a contemporary and critical review of research in this area, and discusses a range of recent findings relating to a range of health issues including HIV and AIDS. Whilst the concept has a resonance for gay men and lesbians, and is widely used in 'lesbian and gay-affirmative' interventions, the paper demonstrates that research findings have been equivocal and the term is often used without full consideration of its sociopolitical consequences. The paper concludes that the concept does have a valuable role to play in health promotion work with lesbians and gay men but invites further discussion and examination of the construct.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1b8b9dccfd8298a636250e385733dd3ab4762d9,c1b8b9dccfd8298a636250e385733dd3ab4762d9

Survival analysis in public health research.,"Elisa T. Lee, O. Go","This paper reviews the common statistical techniques employed to analyze survival data in public health research. Due to the presence of censoring, the data are not amenable to the usual method of analysis. The improvement in statistical computing and wide accessibility of personal computers led to the rapid development and popularity of nonparametric over parametric procedures. The former required less stringent conditions. But, if the assumptions for parametric methods hold, the resulting estimates have smaller standard errors and are easier to interpret. Nonparametric techniques include the Kaplan-Meier method for estimating the survival function and the Cox proportional hazards model to identify risk factors and to obtain adjusted risk ratios. In cases where the assumption of proportional hazards is not tenable, the data can be stratified and a model fitted with different baseline functions in each stratum. Parametric modeling such as the accelerated failure time model also may be used. Hazard functions for the exponential, Weibull, gamma, Gompertz, lognormal, and log-logistic distributions are described. Examples from published literature are given to illustrate the various methods. The paper is intended for public health professionals who are interested in survival data analysis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4dd20467aac451bc536457658cd0bd7c1a8cc267,4dd20467aac451bc536457658cd0bd7c1a8cc267

Toward a conceptual framework of agile methods: a study of agility in different disciplines,"Kieran Conboy, Brian Fitzgerald","Since the software crisis of the 1960's, numerous methodologies have been developed to impose a disciplined process upon software development. It is now widely accepted that these methodologies are unsuccessful and unpopular due to their increasingly bureaucratic nature. Many researchers and practitioners are calling for these heavyweight methodologies to be replaced by agile methods. The Agile Manifesto was put forward in 2001, and several method instantiations, such as XP, SCRUM and Crystal exist. Each adheres to some principles of the Agile Manifesto and disregards others. This paper proposes that these Agile Manifesto principles are insufficiently grounded in theory, and are largely naive to the concept of agility outside the field of software development. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive framework of software development agility, through a thorough review of agility across many disciplines. We then elaborate and evaluate the framework in a software development context, through a review of software related research over the last 30 years.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abb5969eaf738537cb27f2e9960baaa35c4dc2ec,abb5969eaf738537cb27f2e9960baaa35c4dc2ec

Rice Crop Yield Prediction using Data Mining Techniques: An Overview,"R. Paper, Dakshayini R Patil, Dept of Cse PG Scholar, P.G.Halakatti","— This paper shows the overview of rice crop yield prediction. Examines Different data mining techniques utilized for foreseeing rice crop yield. Rice crop creation assumes an imperative part in sustenance security of India, contributing over 40% to general yield generation. High harvest generation is reliant on appropriate climatic conditions. Inconvenient regular atmosphere conditions, for example, low precipitation or temperature extremes can drastically diminish edit yield. Growing better strategies to foresee edit efficiency in various climatic conditions can help rancher and different partners in vital basic leadership as far as agronomy and harvest decision. This paper reports utilization of various information mining methods will anticipate rice trim yield for Maharashtra state, India. To this review, 27 regions of Maharashtra were picked on the establishment of accessible information from openly available Indian Administration records with different atmosphere and harvest parameters. Precipitation, least temperature, normal temperature, most extreme temperature, reference trim evapotranspiration, range, generation and yield for the Kharif season (June to November) were the parameters choosen for the study for the years 1998 to 2002.

The rhetoric of research,R. Horton,"A naturalist's life would be a happy one if he had only to observe and never to write. (Charles Darwin)

Be careful while reading this article. My purpose is to persuade. To achieve this goal I must not only appeal to your intellect and seek your sympathy for my point of view but also diminish your natural reticence to believe all that you read. If I am successful you should remain unaware of my intention to penetrate your critical guard.

Medical journals—and grant awarding bodies for that matter—proudly adhere to the rigours of peer review despite the striking lack of research about either its efficacy or its reliability. But this system of collegiate accountability frequently ignores a factor that, to the doctor or scientist, may be thought too trivial to devote much attention to: the manipulation of language to convince the reader of the likely truth of a result.

The task of removing hyperbole from a paper is normally left to an editor. But just as qualitative review of research demands knowledge about the subject of that research, and just as statistical review requires mathematical skill, so the analysis of argument demands an understanding of the tools of persuasion available to the author. To interpret a result correctly reviewers, statisticians, editors, and readers should know the conscious and unconscious tricks of authorial rhetoric.

Although applied widely, peer review is by no means a secure discipline. For instance, Altman is critical of the entire notion of peer review, a term that he believes is jargon with no agreed meaning.1 He has described good peer review as the equivalent of good technical editing.

This view is unreasonable. Qualitative and statistical analyses of a research paper frequently raise important issues that, when resolved, improve the manuscript substantially.2 If peer review is …",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a463320df6b15a908308e3b0653fb8c03ffc5045,a463320df6b15a908308e3b0653fb8c03ffc5045
A guide to systematic reviews.,I. Needleman,"Systematic reviews have become widely used for evaluating evidence across all fields of biomedicine. The objective of a systematic review is to provide a comprehensive and contemporary appraisal of research using transparent methods whilst aiming to minimize bias. In essence, research methodology is employed in the conduct of the review. Such reviews are therefore fundamentally different from traditional 'narrative' review articles in their purpose and in their potential to aid clinical decision-making. This paper is a guide to the rationale and nature of systematic reviews and will provide a background to understanding their use in clinical practice.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7274e4f9af5a4921c72e43981a3fff6fc42a8b42,7274e4f9af5a4921c72e43981a3fff6fc42a8b42
INTEGRITY TESTING FOR PERSONNEL SELECTION: AN UPDATE,"P. Sackett, L. Burris, Christine Callahan","Sackett and M. M. Harris (1984) reviewed published and unpublished literature on the use of commercially available paper-and-pencil integrity tests for employee selection. This paper reviews recent developments in this area. Legal issues related to the use of the polygraph, and integrity tests are discussed. Empirical research on the reliability, criterion-related validity, construct validity, fakability, and adverse impact of integrity tests is reviewed. Major changes since the previous review include (1) the emergence of two distinct types of tests, labeled overt integrity tests and personality-oriented measures, (2) a broadening of the criteria used for test validation to include global performance, absence, turnover, and forms of counterproductivity other than theft, and (3) an increase in the use of external criteria (e.g., detected theft, turnover) rather than self-report criteria (e.g., admissions of theft) in validation research.

Review Paper on Hardware of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces,"Biswarup Rana, Sung-Sil Cho, I. Hong","Recently reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted great attention because it can create a smart wireless environment. Hence it can enhance the capacity and coverage of the wireless network significantly. A thorough review of RISs has been presented in this paper focusing on the hardware aspect of the RIS. Beyond-5G/6G communication will have a smart propagation environment, where RIS can be used for such communications. RIS consists of various small unit cells. The unit cells should have some tunning mechanism to reflect or transmit the incoming waves in the desired direction. It is possible to tune the impedance of the unit cells using PIN diodes, varactor didoes, microelectromechanical (MEMS), thermal, and other ways. In this paper, the background of RIS has been discussed where RIS will play a significant role in beyond-5G/6G communications. We have also added the theoretical background of RIS and motivations to writing this paper. After that several published papers in the literature have been presented so that the readers can get an overall idea about the RIS and its hardware. Hence, this paper will be very useful for practitioner engineers and researchers. RISs have been presented in various tables and various parameters have been presented. We have discussed challenges and solutions for the hardware of the RIS design. We have also discussed potential research and research gap that can be explored in the future. Lastly, we have added a conclusion for this review paper. In our manuscript, we have added 154 references. There are various kinds of RIS available in the literature. We have added different types of RISs in this manuscript.

The Prospects of Zinc as a Structural Material for Biodegradable Implants—A Review Paper,"G. Levy, J. Goldman, E. Aghion","In the last decade, iron and magnesium, both pure and alloyed, have been extensively studied as potential biodegradable metals for medical applications. However, broad experience with these material systems has uncovered critical limitations in terms of their suitability for clinical applications. Recently, zinc and zinc-based alloys have been proposed as new additions to the list of degradable metals and as promising alternatives to magnesium and iron. The main byproduct of zinc metal corrosion, Zn2+, is highly regulated within physiological systems and plays a critical role in numerous fundamental cellular processes. Zn2+ released from an implant may suppress harmful smooth muscle cells and restenosis in arteries, while stimulating beneficial osteogenesis in bone. An important limitation of pure zinc as a potential biodegradable structural support, however, lies in its low strength (σUTS ~ 30 MPa) and plasticity (e < 0.25%) that are insufficient for most medical device applications. Developing high strength and ductility zinc with sufficient hardness, while retaining its biocompatibility, is one of the main goals of metallurgical engineering. This paper will review and compare the biocompatibility, corrosion behavior and mechanical properties of pure zinc, as well as currently researched zinc alloys.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64768ba6c0f1f6a3472458a846376f0a51cd7536,64768ba6c0f1f6a3472458a846376f0a51cd7536

Review Paper: Medication-related Clinical Decision Support in Computerized Provider Order Entry Systems: A Review,"G. Kuperman, A. Bobb, T. Payne, A. Avery, T. Gandhi, Gerard Burns, D. Classen, D. Bates","While medications can improve patients' health, the process of prescribing them is complex and error prone, and medication errors cause many preventable injuries. Computer provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS), can improve patient safety and lower medication-related costs. To realize the medication-related benefits of CDS within CPOE, one must overcome significant challenges. Healthcare organizations implementing CPOE must understand what classes of CDS their CPOE systems can support, assure that clinical knowledge underlying their CDS systems is reasonable, and appropriately represent electronic patient data. These issues often influence to what extent an institution will succeed with its CPOE implementation and achieve its desired goals. Medication-related decision support is probably best introduced into healthcare organizations in two stages, basic and advanced. Basic decision support includes drug-allergy checking, basic dosing guidance, formulary decision support, duplicate therapy checking, and drug-drug interaction checking. Advanced decision support includes dosing support for renal insufficiency and geriatric patients, guidance for medication-related laboratory testing, drug-pregnancy checking, and drug-disease contraindication checking. In this paper, the authors outline some of the challenges associated with both basic and advanced decision support and discuss how those challenges might be addressed. The authors conclude with summary recommendations for delivering effective medication-related clinical decision support addressed to healthcare organizations, application and knowledge base vendors, policy makers, and researchers.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abdf9538f96b5ebf80b419a6c8e03a5291e49b83,abdf9538f96b5ebf80b419a6c8e03a5291e49b83

Review Paper: A Systematic Review of Patient Acceptance of Consumer Health Information Technology,"C. Or, B. Karsh","A systematic literature review was performed to identify variables promoting consumer health information technology (CHIT) acceptance among patients. The electronic bibliographic databases Web of Science, Business Source Elite, CINAHL, Communication and Mass Media Complete, MEDLINE, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo were searched. A cited reference search of articles meeting the inclusion criteria was also conducted to reduce misses. Fifty-two articles met the selection criteria. Among them, 94 different variables were tested for associations with acceptance. Most of those tested (71%) were patient factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, health- and treatment-related variables, and prior experience or exposure to computer/health technology. Only ten variables were related to human-technology interaction; 16 were organizational factors; and one was related to the environment. In total, 62 (66%) were found to predict acceptance in at least one study. Existing literature focused largely on patient-related factors. No studies examined the impact of social and task factors on acceptance, and few tested the effects of organizational or environmental factors on acceptance. Future research guided by technology acceptance theories should fill those gaps to improve our understanding of patient CHIT acceptance, which in turn could lead to better CHIT design and implementation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/320476720a40383508cd919ce1c818d0d5bdc60f,320476720a40383508cd919ce1c818d0d5bdc60f
Review Paper. Microbe-clay mineral interactions,"Hailiang Dong, D. Jaisi, Jin-wook Kim, Gengxin Zhang","Abstract Clays and clay minerals are common components in soils, sediments, and sedimentary rocks, and they play an important role in many environmental processes. Iron is ubiquitous in clays and clay minerals and its oxidation state, in part, controls the physical and chemical properties of these fine-grained minerals. The structural ferric iron in clay minerals can be reduced either chemically or biologically. Biological reductants include mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms from diverse environments such as soils, sediments, sedimentary rocks, and hydrothermal hot springs. Multiple clay minerals have been used for microbial reduction studies, including dioctahedral smectite-illite series, palygorskite, chlorite, and their various mixtures in natural soils and sediments. All of these clay minerals are reducible by microorganisms under various conditions with smectite (nontronite) being the most reducible and illite the least. The rate and extent of bioreduction depends on many experimental factors, such as the type of microorganisms and clay minerals, solution chemistry, and temperature. Despite significant efforts, current understanding of the mechanisms of microbial reduction of ferric iron in clay minerals is still limited. Whereas some studies have presented evidence for a solid-state reduction mechanism, others argue that the clay mineral structure partially dissolves when the extent of reduction is high. This inconsistency may be related to several experimental conditions, and their specific effects are discussed in this paper. Whereas past experiments have been largely conducted in well-controlled laboratory systems, recent efforts have attempted to transfer knowledge to the field to improve our understanding of more complex soil systems for better agricultural practices. Biologically reduced clay minerals are also important agents in remediating inorganic and organic contaminants in soil and groundwater systems. This paper reviews the most recent developments and suggests some directions for future research",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e5740c54d9c2ae08d8dd569241f9f7759f3e518,3e5740c54d9c2ae08d8dd569241f9f7759f3e518
Review paper: Informatics Systems to Promote Improved Care for Chronic Illness: A Literature Review,"D. Dorr, L. Bonner, Amy N. Cohen, Rebecca S. Shoai, R. Perrin, E. Chaney, A. Young","OBJECTIVE
To understand information systems components important in supporting team-based care of chronic illness through a literature search.


DESIGN
Systematic search of literature from 1996-2005 for evaluations of information systems used in the care of chronic illness.


MEASUREMENTS
The relationship of design, quality, information systems components, setting, and other factors with process, quality outcomes, and health care costs was evaluated.


RESULTS
In all, 109 articles were reviewed involving 112 information system descriptions. Chronic diseases targeted included diabetes (42.9% of reviewed articles), heart disease (36.6%), and mental illness (23.2%), among others. System users were primarily physicians, nurses, and patients. Sixty-seven percent of reviewed experiments had positive outcomes; 94% of uncontrolled, observational studies claimed positive results. Components closely correlated with positive experimental results were connection to an electronic medical record, computerized prompts, population management (including reports and feedback), specialized decision support, electronic scheduling, and personal health records. Barriers identified included costs, data privacy and security concerns, and failure to consider workflow. CONCLUSION The majority of published studies revealed a positive impact of specific health information technology components on chronic illness care.

Roberts","This Position Paper aims to review and discuss the available data on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antibacterials, antifungals and antivirals in critically ill adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This Position Paper also provides a practical guide on how TDM can be applied in routine clinical practice to improve therapeutic outcomes in critically ill adult patients. Literature review and analysis were performed by Panel Members nominated by the endorsing organisations, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and Critically Ill Patient Study Groups of European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), International Association for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT) and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC). Panel members made recommendations for whether TDM should be applied clinically for different antimicrobials/classes. TDM-guided dosing has been shown to be clinically beneficial for aminoglycosides, voriconazole and ribavirin. For most common antibiotics and antifungals in the ICU, a clear therapeutic range has been established, and for these agents, routine TDM in critically ill patients appears meritorious. For the antivirals, research is needed to identify therapeutic targets and determine whether antiviral TDM is indeed meritorious in this patient population. The Panel Members recommend routine TDM to be performed for aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, linezolid, teicoplanin, vancomycin and voriconazole in critically ill patients. Although TDM should be the standard of care for most antimicrobials in every ICU, important barriers need to be addressed before routine TDM can be widely employed worldwide.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d9c95808b8cf872d04bb8eaec66b9dd0ba80161,1d9c95808b8cf872d04bb8eaec66b9dd0ba80161

Stjarne","The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020 is the update of similar evidence based position papers published in 2005 and 2007 and 2012. The core objective of the EPOS2020 guideline is to provide revised, up-to-date and clear evidence-based recommendations and integrated care pathways in ARS and CRS. EPOS2020 provides an update on the literature published and studies undertaken in the eight years since the EPOS2012 position paper was published and addresses areas not extensively covered in EPOS2012 such as paediatric CRS and sinus surgery. EPOS2020 also involves new stakeholders, including pharmacists and patients, and addresses new target users who have become more involved in the management and treatment of rhinosinusitis since the publication of the last EPOS document, including pharmacists, nurses, specialised care givers and indeed patients themselves, who employ increasing self-management of their condition using over the counter treatments. The document provides suggestions for future research in this area and offers updated guidance for definitions and outcome measurements in research in different settings. EPOS2020 contains chapters on definitions and classification where we have defined a large number of terms and indicated preferred terms. A new classification of CRS into primary and secondary CRS and further division into localized and diffuse disease, based on anatomic distribution is proposed. There are extensive chapters on epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, (differential) diagnosis of facial pain, allergic rhinitis, genetics, cystic fibrosis, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, immunodeficiencies, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and the relationship between upper and lower airways. The chapters on paediatric acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are totally rewritten. All available evidence for the management of acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps in adults and children is systematically reviewed and integrated care pathways based on the evidence are proposed. Despite considerable increases in the amount of quality publications in recent years, a large number of practical clinical questions remain. It was agreed that the best way to address these was to conduct a Delphi exercise . The results have been integrated into the respective sections.

Its ability to model composites and factors makes it a formidable statistical tool for new technology research. Recent reviews, discussions, and developments have led to substantial changes in the understanding and use of PLS. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper aggregates new insights and offers a fresh look at PLS path modeling. It presents new developments, such as consistent PLS, confirmatory composite analysis, and the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. Findings – PLS path modeling is the method of choice if a SEM contains both factors and composites. Novel tests of exact fit make a confirmatory use of PLS path modeling possible.

Santamaría, M. Fadhel, Muthana Al-Amidie, Laith Farhan","In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0084f3cb0a1754272151c5268a783f24bf5676a0,0084f3cb0a1754272151c5268a783f24bf5676a0

Auxetic metamaterials and structures: a review,"X. Ren, R. Das, P. Tran, T. Ngo, Y. Xie","Materials and structures with negative Poisson’s ratio exhibit a counter-intuitive behaviour. Under uniaxial compression (tension), these materials and structures contract (expand) transversely. The materials and structures that possess this feature are also termed as ‘auxetics’. Many desirable properties resulting from this uncommon behaviour are reported. These superior properties offer auxetics broad potential applications in the fields of smart filters, sensors, medical devices and protective equipment. However, there are still challenging problems which impede a wider application of auxetic materials. This review paper mainly focuses on the relationships among structures, materials, properties and applications of auxetic metamaterials and structures. The previous works of auxetics are extensively reviewed, including different auxetic cellular models, naturally observed auxetic behaviour, different desirable properties of auxetics, and potential applications. In particular, metallic auxetic materials and a methodology for generating 3D metallic auxetic materials are reviewed in details. Although most of the literature mentions that auxetic materials possess superior properties, very few types of auxetic materials have been fabricated and implemented for practical applications. Here, the challenges and future work on the topic of auxetics are also presented to inspire prospective research work. This review article covers the most recent progress of auxetic metamaterials and auxetic structures. More importantly, several drawbacks of auxetics are also presented to caution researchers in the future study.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30afb29e28e78bc39126034e0f31a80f70b4c7cb,30afb29e28e78bc39126034e0f31a80f70b4c7cb

A Review on Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Semantic Segmentation,"Alberto Garcia-Garcia, Sergio Orts, Sergiu Oprea, Victor Villena-Martinez, J. G. Rodríguez","Image semantic segmentation is more and more being of interest for computer vision and machine learning researchers. Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0f17f99c44807762f2a386ac6579c364330e082,c0f17f99c44807762f2a386ac6579c364330e082
Technology acceptance model in educational context: A systematic literature review,"A. Granić, Nikola Marangunic","A respectable amount of work dealing with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) clearly indicates a popularity of TAM in the field of technology acceptance in general. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend.A number of reviews and meta‐analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted.The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology.What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users.The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching.The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature.The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context.TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology.Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field.By following the most common research objectives and/or by filling current gaps in applied research methods, chosen sample groups and types of result analysis, an own study could be conducted.Future research may well focus on identifying additional external factors that could further explain acceptance and usage of various learning technologies.

A Brief Review of Facial Emotion Recognition Based on Visual Information,ByoungChul Ko,"Facial emotion recognition (FER) is an important topic in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence owing to its significant academic and commercial potential. Although FER can be conducted using multiple sensors, this review focuses on studies that exclusively use facial images, because visual expressions are one of the main information channels in interpersonal communication. This paper provides a brief review of researches in the field of FER conducted over the past decades. First, conventional FER approaches are described along with a summary of the representative categories of FER systems and their main algorithms. Deep-learning-based FER approaches using deep networks enabling “end-to-end” learning are then presented. This review also focuses on an up-to-date hybrid deep-learning approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the spatial features of an individual frame and long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal features of consecutive frames. In the later part of this paper, a brief review of publicly available evaluation metrics is given, and a comparison with benchmark results, which are a standard for a quantitative comparison of FER researches, is described. This review can serve as a brief guidebook to newcomers in the field of FER, providing basic knowledge and a general understanding of the latest state-of-the-art studies, as well as to experienced researchers looking for productive directions for future work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e7ae86a78a9b4860aa720fb0fd0bdc199b092c3,1e7ae86a78a9b4860aa720fb0fd0bdc199b092c3

An automated essay scoring systems: a systematic literature review,"D. Ramesh, Suresh Kumar Sanampudi","Assessment in the Education system plays a significant role in judging student performance. The present evaluation system is through human assessment. As the number of teachers' student ratio is gradually increasing, the manual evaluation process becomes complicated. The drawback of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming, lacks reliability, and many more. This connection online examination system evolved as an alternative tool for pen and paper-based methods. Present Computer-based evaluation system works only for multiple-choice questions, but there is no proper evaluation system for grading essays and short answers. Many researchers are working on automated essay grading and short answer scoring for the last few decades, but assessing an essay by considering all parameters like the relevance of the content to the prompt, development of ideas, Cohesion, and Coherence is a big challenge till now. Few researchers focused on Content-based evaluation, while many of them addressed style-based assessment. This paper provides a systematic literature review on automated essay scoring systems. We studied the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques used to evaluate automatic essay scoring and analyzed the limitations of the current studies and research trends.

Data clustering: a review,"Anil K. Jain, M. Murty, P. Flynn","Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overviewof pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances.

Sustainable Business Models: A Review,"Saeed Nosratabadi, Amir Mosavi, S. Shamshirband, E. Zavadskas, A. Rakotonirainy, K. Chau","During the past two decades of e-commerce growth, the concept of a business model has become increasingly popular. More recently, the research on this realm has grown rapidly, with diverse research activity covering a wide range of application areas. Considering the sustainable development goals, the innovative business models have brought a competitive advantage to improve the sustainability performance of organizations. The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models’ concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and in every category, the progress -either failure or success- has been reviewed, and the research gaps are discussed. Taxonomy of the applications includes innovation, management and marketing, entrepreneurship, energy, fashion, healthcare, agri-food, supply chain management, circular economy, developing countries, engineering, construction and real estate, mobility and transportation, and hospitality. The key contribution of this study is that it provides an insight into the state of the art of sustainable business models in various application areas and future research directions. This paper concludes that popularity and the success rate of sustainable business models in all application domains have been increased along with the increasing use of advanced technologies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8a2e5db4f5276ac0d475636dffda690b7d4ddd9,a8a2e5db4f5276ac0d475636dffda690b7d4ddd9

Towards a Methodology for Developing Evidence-Informed Management Knowledge by Means of Systematic Review,"D. Tranfield, D. Denyer, P. Smart","Undertaking a review of the literature is an important part of any research project. The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge hase. However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can he hiased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contrad ictory evidence has hecome progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has heen questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process hy synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducihie manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge hase and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research.

A Comprehensive Survey on Fog Computing: State-of-the-Art and Research Challenges,"Carla Mouradian, Diala Naboulsi, Sami Yangui, R. Glitho, M. Morrow, P. Polakos","Cloud computing with its three key facets (i.e., Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service) and its inherent advantages (e.g., elasticity and scalability) still faces several challenges. The distance between the cloud and the end devices might be an issue for latency-sensitive applications such as disaster management and content delivery applications. Service level agreements (SLAs) may also impose processing at locations where the cloud provider does not have data centers. Fog computing is a novel paradigm to address such issues. It enables provisioning resources and services outside the cloud, at the edge of the network, closer to end devices, or eventually, at locations stipulated by SLAs. Fog computing is not a substitute for cloud computing but a powerful complement. It enables processing at the edge while still offering the possibility to interact with the cloud. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on fog computing. It critically reviews the state of the art in the light of a concise set of evaluation criteria. We cover both the architectures and the algorithms that make fog systems. Challenges and research directions are also introduced.

Statistical Pattern Recognition: A Review,"Anil K. Jain, R. Duin, J. Mao","The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques.

A review on non-precious metal electrocatalysts for PEM fuel cells,"Zhongwei Chen, Drew C. Higgins, A. Yu, Lei Zhang, Jiujun Zhang","With the approaching commercialization of PEM fuel cell technology, developing active, inexpensive non-precious metal ORR catalyst materials to replace currently used Pt-based catalysts is a necessary and essential requirement in order to reduce the overall system cost. This review paper highlights the progress made over the past 40 years with a detailed discussion of recent works in the area of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction, a necessary reaction at the PEM fuel cell cathode. Several important kinds of unsupported or carbon supported non-precious metal electrocatalysts for ORR are reviewed, including non-pyrolyzed and pyrolyzed transition metal nitrogen-containing complexes, conductive polymer-based catalysts, transition metal chalcogenides, metal oxides/carbides/nitrides/oxynitrides/carbonitrides, and enzymatic compounds. Among these candidates, pyrolyzed transition metal nitrogen-containing complexes supported on carbon materials (M–Nx/C) are considered the most promising ORR catalysts because they have demonstrated some ORR activity and stability close to that of commercially available Pt/C catalysts. Although great progress has been achieved in this area of research and development, there are still some challenges in both their ORR activity and stability. Regarding the ORR activity, the actual volumetric activity of the most active non-precious metal catalyst is still well below the DOE 2015 target. Regarding the ORR stability, stability tests are generally run at low current densities or low power levels, and the lifetime is far shorter than targets set by DOE. Therefore, improving both the ORR activity and stability are the major short and long term focuses of non-precious metal catalyst research and development. Based on the results achieved in this area, several future research directions are also proposed and discussed in this paper.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae83894deca39f8081a98715c6ee07259c656e1e,ae83894deca39f8081a98715c6ee07259c656e1e
Recommendations for Designing and Reviewing Qualitative Research in Psychology: Promoting Methodological Integrity,"H. Levitt, Sue L. Motulsky, Fredrick J. Wertz, Susan L. Morrow, J. Ponterotto","The current paper presents recommendations from the Task Force on Resources for the Publication of Qualitative Research of the Society for Qualitative Inquiry in Psychology, a section of Division 5 of the American Psychological Association. This initiative was a response to concerns by authors that reviews of qualitative research articles frequently utilize inflexible sets of procedures and provide contradictory feedback when evaluating acceptability. In response, the Task Force proposes the concept of methodological integrity and recommends its evaluation via its two composite processes: (a) fidelity to the subject matter, which is the process by which researchers develop and maintain allegiance to the phenomenon under study as it is conceived within their tradition of inquiry, and (b) utility in achieving research goals, which is the process by which researchers select procedures to generate insightful findings that usefully answer their research questions. Questions that guide the evaluation of these processes, example principles, and a flowchart are provided to help authors and reviewers in the process of both research design and review. The consideration of methodological integrity examines whether the implementation of fidelity and utility function coherently together. Researchers and reviewers also examine whether methods further the research goals, are consistent with researchers’ approaches to inquiry, and are tailored to the characteristics of the subject matter and investigators. This approach to evaluation encourages researchers and reviewers to shift from using standardized and decontextualized procedures as criteria for rigor toward assessing the underlying methodological bases for trustworthiness as they function within research projects.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7242ef51bb27489b772041cac48244069003f3c,b7242ef51bb27489b772041cac48244069003f3c

Sample size for qualitative research,C. Boddy,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Qualitative researchers have been criticised for not justifying sample size decisions in their research. This short paper addresses the issue of which sample sizes are appropriate and valid within different approaches to qualitative research. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The sparse literature on sample sizes in qualitative research is reviewed and discussed. This examination is informed by the personal experience of the author in terms of assessing, as an editor, reviewer comments as they relate to sample size in qualitative research. Also, the discussion is informed by the author’s own experience of undertaking commercial and academic qualitative research over the last 31 years. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
In qualitative research, the determination of sample size is contextual and partially dependent upon the scientific paradigm under which investigation is taking place. For example, qualitative research which is oriented towards positivism, will require larger samples than in-depth qualitative research does, so that a representative picture of the whole population under review can be gained. Nonetheless, the paper also concludes that sample sizes involving one single case can be highly informative and meaningful as demonstrated in examples from management and medical research. Unique examples of research using a single sample or case but involving new areas or findings that are potentially highly relevant, can be worthy of publication. Theoretical saturation can also be useful as a guide in designing qualitative research, with practical research illustrating that samples of 12 may be cases where data saturation occurs among a relatively homogeneous population. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Sample sizes as low as one can be justified. Researchers and reviewers may find the discussion in this paper to be a useful guide to determining and critiquing sample size in qualitative research. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Sample size in qualitative research is always mentioned by reviewers of qualitative papers but discussion tends to be simplistic and relatively uninformed. The current paper draws attention to how sample sizes, at both ends of the size continuum, can be justified by researchers. This will also aid reviewers in their making of comments about the appropriateness of sample sizes in qualitative research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52ba952759d6aac72f778144c3d3224d2a680e41,52ba952759d6aac72f778144c3d3224d2a680e41

Funda- mentally, sustainable manufacturing relies on descriptive metrics, advanced decision- making, and public policy for implementation, evaluation, and feedback. In this paper, recent research into concepts, methods, and tools for sustainable manufacturing is explored. At the manufacturing process level, engineering research has addressed issues related to planning, development, analysis, and improvement of processes. At a manufac- turing systems level, engineering research has addressed challenges relating to facility operation, production planning and scheduling, and supply chain design. Though economi- cally vital, manufacturing processes and systems have retained the negative image of being inefficient, polluting, and dangerous. Industrial and academic researchers are re- imagining manufacturing as a source of innovation to meet society’s future needs by under- taking strategic activities focused on sustainable processes and systems. Despite recent developments in decision making and process- and systems-level research, many chal- lenges and opportunities remain. Several of these challenges relevant to manufacturing process and system research, development, implementation, and education are highlighted. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4024040] Andres F.

Knowledge translation of research findings,"J. Grimshaw, M. Eccles, J. Lavis, S. Hill, J. Squires","BackgroundOne of the most consistent findings from clinical and health services research is the failure to translate research into practice and policy. As a result of these evidence-practice and policy gaps, patients fail to benefit optimally from advances in healthcare and are exposed to unnecessary risks of iatrogenic harms, and healthcare systems are exposed to unnecessary expenditure resulting in significant opportunity costs. Over the last decade, there has been increasing international policy and research attention on how to reduce the evidence-practice and policy gap. In this paper, we summarise the current concepts and evidence to guide knowledge translation activities, defined as T2 research (the translation of new clinical knowledge into improved health). We structure the article around five key questions: what should be transferred; to whom should research knowledge be transferred; by whom should research knowledge be transferred; how should research knowledge be transferred; and, with what effect should research knowledge be transferred?DiscussionWe suggest that the basic unit of knowledge translation should usually be up-to-date systematic reviews or other syntheses of research findings. Knowledge translators need to identify the key messages for different target audiences and to fashion these in language and knowledge translation products that are easily assimilated by different audiences. The relative importance of knowledge translation to different target audiences will vary by the type of research and appropriate endpoints of knowledge translation may vary across different stakeholder groups. There are a large number of planned knowledge translation models, derived from different disciplinary, contextual (i.e., setting), and target audience viewpoints. Most of these suggest that planned knowledge translation for healthcare professionals and consumers is more likely to be successful if the choice of knowledge translation strategy is informed by an assessment of the likely barriers and facilitators. Although our evidence on the likely effectiveness of different strategies to overcome specific barriers remains incomplete, there is a range of informative systematic reviews of interventions aimed at healthcare professionals and consumers (i.e., patients, family members, and informal carers) and of factors important to research use by policy makers.SummaryThere is a substantial (if incomplete) evidence base to guide choice of knowledge translation activities targeting healthcare professionals and consumers. The evidence base on the effects of different knowledge translation approaches targeting healthcare policy makers and senior managers is much weaker but there are a profusion of innovative approaches that warrant further evaluation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35284f60afc49eebce964fc46836b8ac6017692b,35284f60afc49eebce964fc46836b8ac6017692b

Research paper recommender system evaluation: a quantitative literature survey,"Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer, Marcel Genzmehr, Bela Gipp, Corinna Breitinger, A. Nürnberger","Over 80 approaches for academic literature recommendation exist today. The approaches were introduced and evaluated in more than 170 research articles, as well as patents, presentations and blogs. We reviewed these approaches and found most evaluations to contain major shortcomings. Of the approaches proposed, 21% were not evaluated. Among the evaluated approaches, 19% were not evaluated against a baseline. Of the user studies performed, 60% had 15 or fewer participants or did not report on the number of participants. Information on runtime and coverage was rarely provided. Due to these and several other shortcomings described in this paper, we conclude that it is currently not possible to determine which recommendation approaches for academic literature are the most promising. However, there is little value in the existence of more than 80 approaches if the best performing approaches are unknown.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/164275911fecf53b4c780ae3848c3376a7168f6c,164275911fecf53b4c780ae3848c3376a7168f6c
Learning to evolve: A review of contemporary lean thinking,"P. Hines, M. Holweg, Nick Rich","The application of lean thinking has made a significant impact both in academic and industrial circles over the last decade. Fostered by a rapid spread into many other industry sectors beyond the automotive industry, there has been a significant development and “localisation” of the lean concept. Despite successful “lean” applications in a range of settings however, the lean approach has been criticised on many accounts, such as the lack of human integration or its limited applicability outside high‐volume repetitive manufacturing environments. The resulting lack of definition has led to confusion and fuzzy boundaries with other management concepts. Summarising the lean evolution, this paper comments on approaches that have sought to address some of the earlier gaps in lean thinking. Linking the evolution of lean thinking to the contingency and learning organisation schools of thought, the objective of this paper is to provide a framework for understanding the evolution of lean not only as a concept, but also its implementation within an organisation, and point out areas for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae433f5d9c3d292504983649444a061aa4ce7ed9,ae433f5d9c3d292504983649444a061aa4ce7ed9

Calderón","Clinical indications for allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in respiratory and Hymenoptera venom allergy are well established; however, clinical contraindications to AIT are not always well documented. There are some discrepancies when classifying clinical contraindications for different forms of AIT as ‘absolute’ or ‘relative’. EAACI Task Force on ‘Contraindications to AIT’ was created to evaluate and review current literature on clinical contraindications, and to update recommendations for both sublingual and subcutaneous AIT for respiratory and venom immunotherapy. An extensive review of the literature was performed on the use of AIT in asthma, autoimmune disorders, malignant neoplasias, cardiovascular diseases, acquired immunodeficiencies and other chronic diseases (including mental disorders), in patients treated with β‐blockers, ACE inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, in children under 5 years of age, during pregnancy and in patients with poor compliance. Each topic was addressed by the following three questions: (1) Are there any negative effects of AIT on this concomitant condition/disease? (2) Are more frequent or more severe AIT‐related side‐effects expected? and (3) Is AIT expected to be less efficacious? The evidence, for the evaluation of these clinical conditions as contraindications, was limited, and most of the conclusions were based on case reports. Based on an extended literature research, recommendations for each medical condition assessed are provided. The final decision on the administration of AIT should be based on individual evaluation of any medical condition and a risk/benefit assessment for each patient.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d4bbe08bec3fcc7ad629e17803685ed2104d382,7d4bbe08bec3fcc7ad629e17803685ed2104d382
Understanding and Evaluating Qualitative Research∗,"E. Fossey, C. Harvey, F. McDermott, L. Davidson","Qualitative research aims to address questions concerned with developing an understanding of the meaning and experience dimensions of humans’ lives and social worlds. Central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. This paper aims to provide beginning researchers, and those unfamiliar with qualitative research, with an orientation to the principles that inform the evaluation of the design, conduct, findings and interpretation of qualitative research. It orients the reader to two philosophical perspectives, the interpretive and critical research paradigms, which underpin both the qualitative research methodologies most often used in mental health research, and how qualitative research is evaluated. Criteria for evaluating quality are interconnected with standards for ethics in qualitative research. They include principles for good practice in the conduct of qualitative research, and for trustworthiness in the interpretation of qualitative data. The paper reviews these criteria, and discusses how they may be used to evaluate qualitative research presented in research reports. These principles also offer some guidance about the conduct of sound qualitative research for the beginner qualitative researcher.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7862b3d449995b9784a22bc323e5fb766f3ac286,7862b3d449995b9784a22bc323e5fb766f3ac286
"Inductive Teaching and Learning Methods: Definitions, Comparisons, and Research Bases","M. Prince, R. Felder","Traditional engineering instruction is deductive, beginning with theories and progressing to the applications of those theories. Alternative teaching approaches are more inductive. Topics are introduced by presenting specific observations, case studies or problems, and theories are taught or the students are helped to discover them only after the need to know them has been established. This study reviews several of the most commonly used inductive teaching methods, including inquiry learning, problem‐based learning, project‐based learning, case‐based teaching, discovery learning, and just‐in‐time teaching. The paper defines each method, highlights commonalities and specific differences, and reviews research on the effectiveness of the methods. While the strength of the evidence varies from one method to another, inductive methods are consistently found to be at least equal to, and in general more effective than, traditional deductive methods for achieving a broad range of learning outcomes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ec41ac408d6c43d08508c03d1c4de72fe0c7aed,7ec41ac408d6c43d08508c03d1c4de72fe0c7aed
Continuity of care: a multidisciplinary review,"J. Haggerty, R. Reid, G. Freeman, B. Starfield, C. Adair, R. McKendry","The concept—and reality—of continuity of care crosses disciplinary and organisational boundaries. The common definitions provided here should help healthcare providers evaluate continuity more rigorously and improve communication 

Patients are increasingly seen by an array of providers in a wide variety of organisations and places, raising concerns about fragmentation of care. Policy reports and charters worldwide urge a concerted effort to enhance continuity,1–3 but efforts to describe the problem or formulate solutions are complicated by the lack of consensus on the definition of continuity. To add to the confusion, other terms such as continuum of care, coordination of care, discharge planning, case management, integration of services, and seamless care are often used synonymously. This synthesis was commissioned by three Canadian health services policy and research bodies. The aim was to develop a common understanding of the concept of continuity as a basis for valid and reliable measurement of practice in different settings.

We searched academic and policy literature for documents in which the principal focus was continuity of patient care or continuity. We searched electronic databases (Medline, HealthSTAR, Embase, CINAHL, Current Contents, PsychINFO, AIDSLINE, CancerLit, Cochrane Library, Dissertation abstracts, Papers1st (conferences and paper abstracts), Web of Science, WorldCat) as well as web library catalogues, peer reviewed internet sites, internet search engines, and several in-house databases. The search included documents dated from 1966 to November 2001 written in English, French, or Spanish. The reviewers (RJR, JLH, RMcK) used a data abstraction form to summarise relevant documents from every health discipline, and all reviewers read key documents.

We presented the results of an initial review of 314 documents to participants of a workshop on continuity held in Vancouver in June 2001. We obtained structured feedback to a discussion paper, problem based scenarios, and expert presentations.

Human motion analysis: a review,"J. Aggarwal, Q. Cai","Human motion analysis is receiving increasing attention from computer vision researchers. This interest is motivated by a wide spectrum of applications, such as athletic performance analysis, surveillance, man-machine interfaces, content-based image storage and retrieval, and video conferencing. The paper gives an overview of the various tasks involved in motion analysis of the human body. The authors focus on three major areas related to interpreting human motion: 1) motion analysis involving human body parts, 2) tracking of human motion using single or multiple cameras, and 3) recognizing human activities from image sequences. Motion analysis of human body parts involves the low-level segmentation of the human body into segments connected by joints, and recovers the 3D structure of the human body using its 2D projections over a sequence of images. Tracking human motion using a single or multiple camera focuses on higher-level processing, in which moving humans are tracked without identifying specific parts of the body structure. After successfully matching the moving human image from one frame to another in image sequences, understanding the human movements or activities comes naturally, which leads to a discussion of recognizing human activities. The review is illustrated by examples.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57a3ddac00d371b1ba2b470c372923fb44a0849e,57a3ddac00d371b1ba2b470c372923fb44a0849e
E-bikes in the Mainstream: Reviewing a Decade of Research,"E. Fishman, C. Cherry","Abstract Electric bicycles (e-bikes) represent one of the fastest growing segments of the transport market. Over 31 million e-bikes were sold in 2012. Research has followed this growth and this paper provides a synthesis of the most pertinent themes emerging over the past on the burgeoning topic of e-bikes. The focus is transport rather than recreational e-bike research, as well as the most critical research gaps requiring attention. China leads the world in e-bike sales, followed by the Netherlands and Germany. E-bikes can maintain speed with less effort. E-bikes are found to increase bicycle usage. E-bikes have the potential to displace conventional motorised (internal combustion) modes, but there are open questions about their role in displacing traditional bicycles. E-bikes have been shown to provide health benefits and an order of magnitude less carbon dioxide than a car travelling the same distance. Safety issues have emerged as a policy issue in several jurisdictions and e-bike numbers are now approaching levels in which adequate safety data are able to be collected. Research on e-bikes is still in its infancy.

The Search for School Climate: A Review of the Research,C. Anderson,"School climate has been studied with a multitude of variables, methodologies, theories, and models, resulting in a not easily defined body of research. This analysis of the school climate literature, based on over 200 references, uses an organizational theory taxonomy to organize the diverse body of research and to draw conclusions about common findings. The history of school climate research is reviewed, noting the influence of climate instruments developed to study climate in settings other than the total school building, such as business, college, and classroom settings. The difficulty of defining school climate is reflected in the diversity of climate typologies that have evolved, despite their often common roots. The debate about school climate is tied to differences among researchers in theory base, variables to study (and their hypothesized interrelationships), unit of measurement choices, and the validity of subjective and qualitative data (based on participant or observer perception). Some common conclusions about school climate (considered as an independent, intervening, or dependent variable) do emerge in the literature. The paper concludes with a summary of the methodological issues common to school climate studies and suggestions for dealing with the concomitant problems",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47e78635c8cdcfbfccbd6c1e3d03c1b2878abdbf,47e78635c8cdcfbfccbd6c1e3d03c1b2878abdbf
A perspective on paper-based microfluidics: Current status and future trends.,"Xu Li, D. Ballerini, W. Shen","""Paper-based microfluidics"" or ""lab on paper,"" as a burgeoning research field with its beginning in 2007, provides a novel system for fluid handling and fluid analysis for a variety of applications including health diagnostics, environmental monitoring as well as food quality testing. The reasons why paper becomes an attractive substrate for making microfluidic systems include: (1) it is a ubiquitous and extremely cheap cellulosic material; (2) it is compatible with many chemical/biochemical/medical applications; and (3) it transports liquids using capillary forces without the assistance of external forces. By building microfluidic channels on paper, liquid flow is confined within the channels, and therefore, liquid flow can be guided in a controlled manner. A variety of 2D and even 3D microfluidic channels have been created on paper, which are able to transport liquids in the predesigned pathways on paper. At the current stage of its development, paper-based microfluidic system is claimed to be low-cost, easy-to-use, disposable, and equipment-free, and therefore, is a rising technology particularly relevant to improving the healthcare and disease screening in the developing world, especially for those areas with no- or low-infrastructure and limited trained medical and health professionals. The research in paper-based microfluidics is experiencing a period of explosion; most published works have focused on: (1) inventing low-cost and simple fabrication techniques for paper-based microfluidic devices; and (2) exploring new applications of paper-based microfluidics by incorporating efficient detection methods. This paper aims to review both the fabrication techniques and applications of paper-based microfluidics reported to date.

This social transformation goes along with psychological pressures that may translate into burnout. After the turn of the century, burnout is increasingly considered as an erosion of a positive psychological state.

Testing measurement invariance across groups: applications in cross-cultural research.,"T. Milfont, R. Fischer","Researchers often compare groups of individuals on psychological variables. When comparing groups an assumption is made that the instrument measures the same psychological construct in all groups. If this assumption holds, the comparisons are valid and differences/similarities between groups can be meaningfully interpreted. If this assumption does not hold, comparisons and interpretations are not fully meaningful. The establishment of measurement invariance is a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons across groups.

Clarifying differences between review designs and methods,"D. Gough, James Thomas, S. Oliver","This paper argues that the current proliferation of types of systematic reviews creates challenges for the terminology for describing such reviews. Terminology is necessary for planning, describing, appraising, and using reviews, building infrastructure to enable the conduct and use of reviews, and for further developing review methodology. There is insufficient consensus on terminology for a typology of reviews to be produced and any such attempt is likely to be limited by the overlapping nature of the dimensions along which reviews vary. It is therefore proposed that the most useful strategy for the field is to develop terminology for the main dimensions of variation. Three such main dimensions are proposed: (1) aims and approaches (including what the review is aiming to achieve, the theoretical and ideological assumptions, and the use of theory and logics of aggregation and configuration in synthesis); (2) structure and components (including the number and type of mapping and synthesis components and how they relate); and (3) breadth and depth and the extent of ‘work done’ in addressing a research issue (including the breadth of review questions, the detail with which they are addressed, and the amount the review progresses a research agenda). This then provides an overarching strategy to encompass more detailed descriptions of methodology and may lead in time to a more overarching system of terminology for systematic reviews.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1375acf8ab165034648564137c2ded9401fd9044,1375acf8ab165034648564137c2ded9401fd9044
Supply chain risk management: outlining an agenda for future research,"Uta Jüttner, H. Peck, M.

Y2K passed seemingly without incident, though the widespread disruptions caused by fuel protests and then Foot and Mouth Disease in the UK, and by terrorist attacks on the USA have underlined the vulnerability of modern supply chains. Despite increasing awareness among practitioners, the concepts of supply chain vulnerability and its managerial counterpart supply chain risk management are still in their infancy. This paper seeks to identify an agenda for future research and to that end the authors go on to clarify the concept of supply chain risk management and to provide a working definition.

"Service oriented architectures: approaches, technologies and research issues","M. Papazoglou, W. Heuvel","Service-oriented architectures (SOA) is an emerging approach that addresses the requirements of loosely coupled, standards-based, and protocol- independent distributed computing. Typically business operations running in an SOA comprise a number of invocations of these different components, often in an event-driven or asynchronous fashion that reflects the underlying business process needs. To build an SOA a highly distributable communications and integration backbone is required. This functionality is provided by the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that is an integration platform that utilizes Web services standards to support a wide variety of communications patterns over multiple transport protocols and deliver value-added capabilities for SOA applications. This paper reviews technologies and approaches that unify the principles and concepts of SOA with those of event-based programing. The paper also focuses on the ESB and describes a range of functions that are designed to offer a manageable, standards-based SOA backbone that extends middleware functionality throughout by connecting heterogeneous components and systems and offers integration services. Finally, the paper proposes an approach to extend the conventional SOA to cater for essential ESB requirements that include capabilities such as service orchestration, “intelligent” routing, provisioning, integrity and security of message as well as service management.

Defining interdisciplinary research: conclusions from a critical review of the literature.,"S. Aboelela, E. Larson, S. Bakken, O. Carrasquillo, A. Formicola, S. Glied, Janet P. Haas, K. Gebbie","OBJECTIVE
To summarize findings from a systematic exploration of existing literature and views regarding interdisciplinarity, to discuss themes and components of such work, and to propose a theoretically based definition of interdisciplinary research.


DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING
Two major data sources were used: interviews with researchers from various disciplines, and a systematic review of the education, business, and health care literature from January 1980 through January 2005.


STUDY DESIGN
Systematic review of literature, one-on-one interviews, field test (survey).


DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS
We reviewed 14 definitions of interdisciplinarity, the characteristics of 42 interdisciplinary research publications from multiple fields of study, and 14 researcher interviews to arrive at a preliminary definition of interdisciplinary research. That definition was then field tested by 12 individuals with interdisciplinary research experience, and their responses incorporated into the definition of interdisciplinary research proposed in this paper.


PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Three key definitional characteristics were identified: the qualitative mode of research (and its theoretical underpinnings), existence of a continuum of synthesis among disciplines, and the desired outcome of the interdisciplinary research.


CONCLUSION
Existing literature from several fields did not provide a definition for interdisciplinary research of sufficient specificity to facilitate activities such as identification of the competencies, structure, and resources needed for health care and health policy research. This analysis led to the proposed definition, which is designed to aid decision makers in funding agencies/program committees and researchers to identify and take full advantage the interdisciplinary approach, and to serve as a basis for competency-based formalized training to provide researchers with interdisciplinary skills.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac4002962c649347a95b8dcc94fcc3dfcca447f6,ac4002962c649347a95b8dcc94fcc3dfcca447f6

This article reviews measures that conservators and collection managers have taken to reduce the acidity of books and other paper-based materials, thereby decreasing the rates of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and other changes leading to embrittlement. Technical challenges include the selection of an alkaline additive, selecting and implementing a way to distribute this alkaline substance uniformly in the sheet and bound volumes, avoiding excessively high pH conditions, minimizing the rate of loss of physical properties such as resistance to folding, and avoiding any conditions that cause evident damage to the documents one is trying to preserve.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviation of salt stress: a review.,"Heikham Evelin, R. Kapoor, Bhoopander Giri","BACKGROUND
Salt stress has become a major threat to plant growth and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant root systems and modulate plant growth in various ways.


SCOPE
This review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. It also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress.


CONCLUSIONS
The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented. This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K(+) : Na(+) ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes. Theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra-structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale.

Reviews of research on the attitude–behavior relationship and their implications for future environmental education research,"T. Marcinkowski, A. Reid","Abstract Since the early days of the field, attitude–behavior (A–B) relationships have received sustained attention in the evaluation and researching of environmental education (EE). This level of interest extends beyond the field’s scope though, in part due to a certain reliance on theoretical and empirical assertions which claim that attitudes serve as a strong precursor and/or predictor of behavior. In this paper, we consider reviews of studies on the A–B relationship in EE and other fields that routinely challenge such assumptions, leading to the questioning of corresponding foci and commitments for research, evaluation, practice, and development. With key findings from these studies to hand, we highlight several insights that may be useful for dispelling some of the folklore about what matters in, and what can be argued with, A–B studies, if we are to develop the design, conduct, reporting, and critique of studies and practices of EE reliant on such relationships.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c387848079af234e319cd4f606140ba6f19e764e,c387848079af234e319cd4f606140ba6f19e764e
Personal determinants of organic food consumption: a review,"J. Aertsens, W. Verbeke, K. Mondelaers, G. Huylenbroeck","– A lot of literature is available that discusses personal determinants of organic food consumption. However different models and determinants are used in the literature. This paper aims to provide an overview, within a framework linking Schwartz' values theory and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Also it seeks to focus on the importance of affective attitude, emotions, personal norm, involvement and uncertainty related to organic food consumption., – The paper is based on secondary data sources, namely the literature concerning personal determinants of organic food consumption., – Both the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour have been referred to as relevant theories for better understanding consumers' choice for organic food. Organic food consumption decisions can be explained by relating attributes of organic food with more abstract values such as “security”, “hedonism”, “universalism”, “benevolence”, “stimulation”, “self‐direction” and “conformity”. Appealing to these values can positively influence attitudes towards organic food consumption. Besides attitude, subjective and personal norm and (perceived) behavioural control influence consumption of organic food., – More research related to the role of uncertainty (reduction) during the process of buying organic food is recommended., – Relatively little research has examined the affective component of attitude and emotions in relation to organic food consumption, while these may play an important role as drivers of involvement and thus help to jolt food purchasers out of their routine of buying conventional food and set a first step to adopt organic food., – To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper providing a comprehensive overview and linking the literature on organic food consumption to the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour, including the role of personal norm and focusing on emotions. The proposed integration of mental processing in an organic food consumption model leads to interesting hypotheses and recommendations for policy makers, researchers and stakeholders involved in the organic food market.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43e53a3837cd1e0081434b950a43165d84fb644e,43e53a3837cd1e0081434b950a43165d84fb644e

This paper provides a comprehensive guide to GANs, covering their architecture, loss functions, training methods, applications, evaluation metrics, challenges, and future directions. We begin with an introduction to GANs and their historical development, followed by a review of the background and related work. We then provide a detailed overview of the GAN architecture, including the generator and discriminator networks, and discuss the key design choices and variations. Next, we review the loss functions utilized in GANs, including the original minimax objective, as well as more recent approaches s.a. Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty. We then delve into the training of GANs, discussing common techniques s.a. alternating optimization, minibatch discrimination, and spectral normalization. We also provide a survey of the various applications of GANs across domains. In addition, we review the evaluation metrics utilized to assess the diversity and quality of GAN-produced data. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and open issues in GANs, including mode collapse, training instability, and ethical considerations. Finally, we provide a glimpse into the future directions of GAN research, including improving scalability, developing new architectures, incorporating domain knowledge, and exploring new applications.

Review: environmental friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials,P. Panda,"Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being considered as potentially attractive alternatives to PZTs for specific applications. In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structure–property correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium titanate, alkali niobates (ANbO3), etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already working in this area and also draw the attention of the others.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ff5447e40b5a59e9bd4a460a965469f878c99c1,7ff5447e40b5a59e9bd4a460a965469f878c99c1
A Review of Research on Subsonic Turbulent Flow Reattachment,"J. Eaton, J. P. Johnston","Introduction T reattachment of a turbulent shear layer is an important process in a large number of practical engineering configurations, including diffusers, airfoils with separation bubbles, buildings, and combustors. In order to predict these complicated flows, we must understand and be able to predict the behavior of reattaching shear layers. However, our current understanding of the reattachment process is poor, a fact demonstrated by our inability to predict simple reattaching flows over a wide range of parameters. In fact, a complete list of the parameters that affect reattachment has yet to be formulated. Among two-dimensional flows, the backward-facing step is the simplest reattaching flow. The separation line is straight and fixed at the edge of the step, and there is only one separated zone instead of two, as seen in the flow over a fence or obstacle. In addition, the streamlines are nearly parallel to the wall at the separation point, so significant upstream influence occurs only downstream of separation. Although they are not always stated explicitly, these are the reasons why most of the research on reattachment has been done in backward-facing step flows. The backward-facing step is also used as a building block flow for workers developing turbulence models. Therefore, it is important to supply data which can be used to test codes and information that may aid the development of future codes. Bradshaw and Wong reviewed the experimental data for reattaching flows in 1972. Since that time there has been a proliferation of new research in the area, particularly since the advent of the laser anemometer and the pulsed-wire anemometer. This research has been conducted by a number of independent groups, and therefore the net result is somewhat disorganized. Very little systematic study has been done on the effect of the governing parameters on reattachment. In addition, most of the experiments, when viewed separately, have failed to cast any new light on the underlying physics of the reattachment process. The purpose of this paper is twofold. The primary purpose is to review the available data for turbulent flows over backward-facing steps, including some new data of our own and other previously unpublished data. Second, we suggest several areas of research that we feel could lead to improvements in our ability to predict flows with separation bubbles. Several physical mechanisms will be proposed to explain some of the phenomena that have been observed. It is our hope that these suggestions will provoke further thought, comment, and research. The review covers subsonic flows over backward-facing steps in which the Reynolds number is high enough to insure that the separated shear layer is fully turbulent. Important work on laminar and transitional reattaching shear layers has been performed by Goldstein et al. and Armaly et al. but will not be referred to here. Primary emphasis is on planar flows, but some data from axisymmetric flows will be utilized. Double-sided, sudden expansion flows in which the flow is asymmetric are not considered here, because these flows are even more complicated than flows with a single separation bubble. A companion paper examines the uncertainty of the available data in more detail. It also assesses the usefulness of the various data sets as test cases for computational procedures.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a75e2eb4ab5a497842864d5a0893714525ca7d3c,a75e2eb4ab5a497842864d5a0893714525ca7d3c
Facility location under uncertainty: a review,L. Snyder,"Plants, distribution centers, and other facilities generally function for years or decades, during which time the environment in which they operate may change substantially. Costs, demands, travel times, and other inputs to classical facility location models may be highly uncertain. This has made the development of models for facility location under uncertainty a high priority for researchers in both the logistics and stochastic/robust optimization communities. Indeed, a large number of the approaches that have been proposed for optimization under uncertainty have been applied to facility location problems. This paper reviews the literature on stochastic and robust facility location models. Our intent is to illustrate both the rich variety of approaches for optimization under uncertainty that have appeared in the literature and their application to facility location problems.

A Review of Psychoendocrine Research on the Pituitary‐Adrenal Cortical System,J. Mason,"&NA; Massive evidence has now accumulated which indicates that the pituitary‐adrenal cortical system responds sensitively to psychological influences. This evidence represents converging and reinforcing findings from diverse studies of many species, including man. It involved the use of many methods of eliciting, isolating, and evaluating emotional disturbances, relatively direct and specific biochemical measurements of endocrine activity, and control measures that permit exclusion of concomitant physical variables. It also appears that the principal experimental or methodological factors which were involved in the relatively few conflicting findings reported in this field have now been largely identified, eliminated, or adequately taken into consideration. There is no longer room for reasonable doubt as to the validity of the basic conclusion that psychological stimuli are capable of influencing the level of pituitary‐adrenal cortical activity. It now appears to be time to consolidate our grasp of the knowledge that is firmly established in this field and to review the implications in order that we may logically decide the most likely directions for fruitful future work along these lines. Some of the general biological conclusions emerging from the work covered in this review may be summarized as follows: Psychological influences are among the most potent natural stimuli known to affect pituitary‐adrenal cortical activity. The remarkable sensitivity of 17‐OHCS levels even to relatively subtle, everyday psychological influences suggests that the central nervous system exerts a constant “tonicity” upon this endocrine system, in much the same fashion as has been previously demonstrated for the autonomic and skeletal muscular effector systems. Elevation of 17‐OHCS levels is not related to a highly specific affective state, but rather appears to reflect a relatively undifferentiated state of emotional arousal or involvement, perhaps in anticipation of activity or coping. The elements of novelty, uncertainty, or unpredictability are particularly potent influences in eliciting 17‐OHCS elevations. Intense, disorganizing emotional reactions with behavioral breakdown are associated with unusually marked 17‐OHCS elevations. Psychological factors may either raise or lower the level of pituitary‐adrenal cortical activity. Some important variables to consider in relation to the direction of 17‐OHCS response are the quality of the emotional reaction, the style and effectiveness of psychological defenses, and whether the threat is of an acute or chronic nature. Marked individual differences in pituitary‐adrenal cortical response to any given situation have been a striking and consistent feature of psychoendocrine studies. Definition of the multiple determinants, psychological and other, of these individual differences is a major goal in the future development of psychoendocrine research. The organization of psychological defenses has been shown to be an especially important factor to consider in the study of this problem. The measurement of 17‐OHCS levels provides the behavioral scientist with a sensitive, objective index of a physiological reflection of emotional state that represents a balance between forces promoting affective arousal or distress versus those of a protective or defensive nature which prevent, minimize, or counteract arousal or distress. Experience in psychoendocrine research on the pituitary‐adrenal cortical system has also yielded a number of important conclusions concerning methodological principles, which have been discussed at some length. These principles deserve wider recognition and should be useful in the future refinement of psychoendocrine research in general. It is perhaps also important to realize that the recent burgeoning development of psychoendocrine research owes both its conception and support largely to psychiatry, and that the dissemination of psychoendocrine data has remained largely within the psychiatric literature ‐as clearly revealed by the inspection of the bibliography for this paper. The many fruitful psychoendocrine approaches to a variety of basic issues in psychiatry which have now been delineated, as reviewed recently, 133 are gradually gaining recognition; thus it is likely that psychoendocrine approaches will be incorporated into psychiatric research programs to an even greater degree in the future as general awareness of their power and potential grows. While the concept of psychological influences upon endocrine function has, in general, been readily accepted by behavioral scientists, it has, however, made very little headway as yet into other biological fields‐particularly physiology and internal medicine. While psychoendocrine concepts may not yet provide the immediate promise of research tools and approaches for these fields as they do in the case of psychiatry, they have profound implications for the study and understanding of physiological integration and must, inescapably, be eventually incorporated into physiological thought. It may be true that the participation of psychological factors in endocrine regulation temporarily “muddies the waters” from the viewpoint of physiological theory, by complicating the servomechanism formulation of endocrine regulation, but this is not by any means the first instance in physiology in which a higher‐level regulatory mechanism has been found to be superimposed upon a lower‐level mechanism. It should also be recognized that there are practical implications involved which the biological investigator concerned with measurement of metabolic or physiological functions in the conscious animal or human can no longer afford to ignore. There is clearly now a burden on such investigators to minimize extraneous environmental and psychological stimuli and to take necessary control measures to rule out the possibility that observed bodily responses are related to psychological or emotional reactions. What really appears to be needed, in fact, is a closer two‐way relationship between psychoendocrinology and physiology. The endocrine glands are regulated in life by both physical and psychological stimuli, in varying combinations, and at present the psychoendocrinologist is perhaps as much in danger of ignoring physical or constitutional factors as the physiologist is of ignoring psychological factors in the experimental study and conceptualization of endocrine regulation. A principal reason for including this review in the present series is to give an impression of the overwhelming weight of evidence for the superimposition of psychological mechanisms upon endocrine regulation. Definitive support for this conclusion in the case of the pituitary‐adrenal cortical system should reasonably be expected to minimize contention over drawing similar conclusions for other endocrine systems if evidence along similar lines is obtained, even though it be on a smaller scale. It is also suggested that the evolution of psychoendocrine research on the pituitary‐adrenal cortical system provides us with a valuable guide to the lines that similar research on other endocrine systems must very likely follow. Finally, a review of the extensive work on this system brings out the relative paucity of studies on most of the other endocrine systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c819393c43ea5f1ef89b8ae5d57e8ed362ded4a,2c819393c43ea5f1ef89b8ae5d57e8ed362ded4a

METHODS AND RESULTS
An expert panel of 25 researchers reviewed the available literature on insomnia research assessments. Preliminary recommendations were reviewed and discussed at a meeting on March 10-11, 2005. These recommendations were further refined during writing of the current paper. The resulting key recommendations for standard research assessment of insomnia disorders include definitions/diagnosis of insomnia and comorbid conditions; measures of sleep and insomnia, including qualitative insomnia measures, diary, polysomnography, and actigraphy; and measures of the waking correlates and consequences of insomnia disorders, such as fatigue, sleepiness, mood, performance, and quality of life.

To address this challenge, a critical appraisal tool was developed: the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The aim of this paper is to present the enhancements made to the MMAT. DEVELOPMENT: The MMAT was initially developed in 2006 based on a literature review on systematic reviews combining qualitative and quantitative evidence. It was subject to pilot and interrater reliability testing. A revised version of the MMAT was developed in 2018 based on the results from usefulness testing, a literature review on critical appraisal tools and a modified e-Delphi study with methodological experts to identify core criteria. TOOL DESCRIPTION: The MMAT assesses the quality of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. It focuses on methodological criteria and includes five core quality criteria for each of the following five categories of study designs: (a) qualitative, (b) randomized controlled, (c) nonrandomized, (d) quantitative descriptive, and (e) mixed methods. CONCLUSION: The MMAT is a unique tool that can be used to appraise the quality of different study designs.

Biodegradable polymers applied in tissue engineering research: a review,"M. Martina, D. Hutmacher","Typical applications and research areas of polymeric biomaterials include tissue replacement, tissue augmentation, tissue support, and drug delivery. In many cases the body needs only the temporary presence of a device/biomaterial, in which instance biodegradable and certain partially biodegradable polymeric materials are better alternatives than biostable ones. Recent treatment concepts based on scaffold-based tissue engineering principles differ from standard tissue replacement and drug therapies as the engineered tissue aims not only to repair but also regenerate the target tissue. Cells have been cultured outside the body for many years; however, it has only recently become possible for scientists and engineers to grow complex three-dimensional tissue grafts to meet clinical needs. New generations of scaffolds based on synthetic and natural polymers are being developed and evaluated at a rapid pace, aimed at mimicking the structural characteristics of natural extracellular matrix. This review focuses on scaffolds made of more recently developed synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications. Currently, the design and fabrication of biodegradable synthetic scaffolds is driven by four material categories: (i) common clinically established polymers, including polyglycolide, polylactides, polycaprolactone; (ii) novel di- and tri-block polymers; (iii) newly synthesized or studied polymeric biomaterials, such as polyorthoester, polyanhydrides, polyhydroxyalkanoate, polypyrroles, poly(ether ester amide)s, elastic shape-memory polymers; and (iv) biomimetic materials, supramolecular polymers formed by self-assembly, and matrices presenting distinctive or a variety of biochemical cues. This paper aims to review the latest developments from a scaffold material perspective, mainly pertaining to categories (ii) and (iii) listed above.

Human hallucinogen research: guidelines for safety,"Mw Johnson, W. Richards, R. Griffiths","There has recently been a renewal of human research with classical hallucinogens (psychedelics). This paper first briefly discusses the unique history of human hallucinogen research, and then reviews the risks of hallucinogen administration and safeguards for minimizing these risks. Although hallucinogens are relatively safe physiologically and are not considered drugs of dependence, their administration involves unique psychological risks. The most likely risk is overwhelming distress during drug action ('bad trip'), which could lead to potentially dangerous behaviour such as leaving the study site. Less common are prolonged psychoses triggered by hallucinogens. Safeguards against these risks include the exclusion of volunteers with personal or family history of psychotic disorders or other severe psychiatric disorders, establishing trust and rapport between session monitors and volunteer before the session, careful volunteer preparation, a safe physical session environment and interpersonal support from at least two study monitors during the session. Investigators should probe for the relatively rare hallucinogen persisting perception disorder in follow-up contact. Persisting adverse reactions are rare when research is conducted along these guidelines. Incautious research may jeopardize participant safety and future research. However, carefully conducted research may inform the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and may lead to advances in basic science.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/554f798f25a69d215bea816211ae014c5319edac,554f798f25a69d215bea816211ae014c5319edac

Implications for neurobiological research of cognitive models of psychosis: a theoretical paper,"P. Garety, P. Bebbington, D. Fowler, D. Freeman, E. Kuipers","ABSTRACT Background Cognitive models of the positive symptoms of psychosis specify the cognitive, social and emotional processes hypothesized to contribute to their occurrence and persistence, and propose that vulnerable individuals make characteristic appraisals that result in specific positive symptoms. Method We describe cognitive models of positive psychotic symptoms and use this as the basis of discussing recent relevant empirical investigations and reviews that integrate cognitive approaches into neurobiological frameworks. Results Evidence increasingly supports a number of the hypotheses proposed by cognitive models. These are that: psychosis is on a continuum; specific cognitive processes are risk factors for the transition from subclinical experiences to clinical disorder; social adversity and trauma are associated with psychosis and with negative emotional processes; and these emotional processes contribute to the occurrence and persistence of psychotic symptoms. There is also evidence that reasoning biases contribute to the occurrence of delusions. Conclusions The benefits of incorporating cognitive processes into neurobiological research include more sophisticated, bidirectional and interactive causal models, the amplification of phenotypes in neurobiological investigations by including emotional processes, and the adoption of more specific clinical phenotypes. For example, there is potential value in studying gene×environment×cognition/emotion interactions. Cognitive models and their derived phenotypes constitute the missing link in the chain between genetic or acquired biological vulnerability, the social environment and the expression of individual positive symptoms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c394d9a2833c37472550acacad18020538a1e79,4c394d9a2833c37472550acacad18020538a1e79

"Semantic database modeling: survey, applications, and research issues","R. Hull, R. King","Most common database management systems represent information in a simple record-based format. Semantic modeling provides richer data structuring capabilities for database applications. In particular, research in this area has articulated a number of constructs that provide mechanisms for representing structurally complex interrelations among data typically arising in commercial applications. In general terms, semantic modeling complements work on knowledge representation (in artificial intelligence) and on the new generation of database models based on the object-oriented paradigm of programming languages.
This paper presents an in-depth discussion of semantic data modeling. It reviews the philosophical motivations of semantic models, including the need for high-level modeling abstractions and the reduction of semantic overloading of data type constructors. It then provides a tutorial introduction to the primary components of semantic models, which are the explicit representation of objects, attributes of and relationships among objects, type constructors for building complex types, ISA relationships, and derived schema components. Next, a survey of the prominent semantic models in the literature is presented. Further, since a broad area of research has developed around semantic modeling, a number of related topics based on these models are discussed, including data languages, graphical interfaces, theoretical investigations, and physical implementation strategies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eda424538bab229d38f03a97d3ed1731e2a2c871,eda424538bab229d38f03a97d3ed1731e2a2c871

Michie","Without a complete published description of interventions, clinicians and patients cannot reliably implement interventions that are shown to be useful, and other researchers cannot replicate or build on research findings. The quality of description of interventions in publications, however, is remarkably poor. To improve the completeness of reporting, and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide item selection, and a face to face panel meeting. The resultant 12 item TIDieR checklist (brief name, why, what (materials), what (procedure), who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications, how well (planned), how well (actual)) is an extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement (item 5) and the SPIRIT 2013 statement (item 11). While the emphasis of the checklist is on trials, the guidance is intended to apply across all evaluative study designs. This paper presents the TIDieR checklist and guide, with an explanation and elaboration for each item, and examples of good reporting. The TIDieR checklist and guide should improve the reporting of interventions and make it easier for authors to structure accounts of their interventions, reviewers and editors to assess the descriptions, and readers to use the information.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c26bc5a2332e38a9157bcc8e542767029eeebf9d,c26bc5a2332e38a9157bcc8e542767029eeebf9d
Intelligent agents: theory and practice,"M. Wooldridge, N. Jennings","Abstract The concept of an agent has become important in both artificial intelligence (AT) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d621786b597687f555fae83dc1a021fd21713d90,d621786b597687f555fae83dc1a021fd21713d90

Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework,"H. Arksey, L. O’Malley","This paper focuses on scoping studies, an approach to reviewing the literature which to date has received little attention in the research methods literature. We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f12499d98165f62f07f928f913bc184a1be6045c,f12499d98165f62f07f928f913bc184a1be6045c

Review: Semiconductor Piezoresistance for Microsystems,"A. Barlian, W. Park, J. Mallon, A. Rastegar, B. Pruitt","Piezoresistive sensors are among the earliest micromachined silicon devices. The need for smaller, less expensive, higher performance sensors helped drive early micromachining technology, a precursor to microsystems or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The effect of stress on doped silicon and germanium has been known since the work of Smith at Bell Laboratories in 1954. Since then, researchers have extensively reported on microscale, piezoresistive strain gauges, pressure sensors, accelerometers, and cantilever force/displacement sensors, including many commercially successful devices. In this paper, we review the history of piezoresistance, its physics and related fabrication techniques. We also discuss electrical noise in piezoresistors, device examples and design considerations, and alternative materials. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of integrated piezoresistor technology with an introduction to the physics of piezoresistivity, process and material selection and design guidance useful to researchers and device engineers.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8a4b6093f02b5b29b13d79dc8d68116b78e2ec5,c8a4b6093f02b5b29b13d79dc8d68116b78e2ec5
The PRISMA Statement for Reporting Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Studies That Evaluate Health Care Interventions: Explanation and Elaboration,"A. Liberati, Douglas G. Altman, J. Tetzlaff, Cynthia Mulrow, Peter Gtzsche, John P Ioannidis, Mike Clarke, P. Devereaux, Jos Kleijnen, David Moher","Editor's Note: In order to encourage dissemination of the PRISMA explanatory paper, this article is freely accessible on the Annals of Internal Medicine, PLoS Medicine, and BMJ Web sites. The authors jointly hold the copyright of this article. For details on further use, see the PRISMA Web site (www.prisma-statement.org). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for summarizing evidence accurately and reliably. They help clinicians keep up-to-date; provide evidence for policy makers to judge risks, benefits, and harms of health care behaviors and interventions; gather together and summarize related research for patients and their carers; provide a starting point for clinical practice guideline developers; provide summaries of previous research for funders wishing to support new research (1); and help editors judge the merits of publishing reports of new studies (2). Recent data suggest that at least 2,500 new systematic reviews reported in English are indexed in MEDLINE annually (3). Unfortunately, there is considerable evidence that key information is often poorly reported in systematic reviews, thus diminishing their potential usefulness (36). As is true for all research, systematic reviews should be reported fully and transparently to allow readers to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the investigation (7). That rationale led to the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement; those detailed reporting recommendations were published in 1999 (8). In this paper we describe the updating of that guidance. Our aim is to ensure clear presentation of what was planned, done, and found in a systematic review. Terminology used to describe systematic reviews and meta-analyses has evolved over time and varies across different groups of researchers and authors (see Box 1). In this document we adopt the definitions used by the Cochrane Collaboration (9). A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods that are selected to minimize bias, thus providing reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made. Meta-analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize and combine the results of independent studies. Many systematic reviews contain meta-analyses, but not all. Box 1. Terminology. The QUOROM Statement and Its Evolution Into PRISMA The QUOROM Statement, developed in 1996 and published in 1999 (8), was conceived as a reporting guidance for authors reporting a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Since then, much has happened. First, knowledge about the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews has expanded considerably. For example, The Cochrane Library's Methodology Register (which includes reports of studies relevant to the methods for systematic reviews) now contains more than 11,000 entries (March 2009). Second, there have been many conceptual advances, such as outcome-level assessments of the risk of bias (10, 11), that apply to systematic reviews. Third, authors have increasingly used systematic reviews to summarize evidence other than that provided by randomized trials. However, despite advances, the quality of the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews remains well short of ideal (36). All of these issues prompted the need for an update and expansion of the QUOROM Statement. Of note, recognizing that the updated statement now addresses the above conceptual and methodological issues and may also have broader applicability than the original QUOROM Statement, we changed the name of the reporting guidance to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). Development of PRISMA The PRISMA Statement was developed by a group of 29 review authors, methodologists, clinicians, medical editors, and consumers (12). They attended a three-day meeting in 2005 and participated in extensive post-meeting electronic correspondence. A consensus process that was informed by evidence, whenever possible, was used to develop a 27-item checklist (Table 1; see also Table S1, for a downloadable template checklist for researchers to re-use) and a four-phase flow diagram (Figure 1; see also Figure S1, for a downloadable template document for researchers to re-use). Items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review were included in the checklist. The flow diagram originally proposed by QUOROM was also modified to show numbers of identified records, excluded articles, and included studies. After 11 revisions the group approved the checklist, flow diagram, and this explanatory paper. Table S1. Template checklist Figure S1. Template document Table 1. Checklist of Items to Include When Reporting a Systematic Review (With or Without Meta-Analysis) Figure 1. Flow of information through the different phases of a systematic review. The PRISMA Statement itself provides further details regarding its background and development (12). This accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document explains the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. A few PRISMA Group participants volunteered to help draft specific items for this document, and four of these (DGA, AL, DM, and JT) met on several occasions to further refine the document, which was circulated and ultimately approved by the larger PRISMA Group. Scope of PRISMA PRISMA focuses on ways in which authors can ensure the transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It does not address directly or in a detailed manner the conduct of systematic reviews, for which other guides are available (1316). We developed the PRISMA Statement and this explanatory document to help authors report a wide array of systematic reviews to assess the benefits and harms of a health care intervention. We consider most of the checklist items relevant when reporting systematic reviews of non-randomized studies assessing the benefits and harms of interventions. However, we recognize that authors who address questions relating to etiology, diagnosis, or prognosis, for example, and who review epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy studies may need to modify or incorporate additional items for their systematic reviews. How To Use This Paper We modeled this Explanation and Elaboration document after those prepared for other reporting guidelines (1719). To maximize the benefit of this document, we encourage people to read it in conjunction with the PRISMA Statement (11). We present each checklist item and follow it with a published exemplar of good reporting for that item. (We edited some examples by removing citations or Web addresses, or by spelling out abbreviations.) We then explain the pertinent issue, the rationale for including the item, and relevant evidence from the literature, whenever possible. No systematic search was carried out to identify exemplars and evidence. We also include seven Boxes that provide a more comprehensive explanation of certain thematic aspects of the methodology and conduct of systematic reviews. Although we focus on a minimal list of items to consider when reporting a systematic review, we indicate places where additional information is desirable to improve transparency of the review process. We present the items numerically from 1 to 27; however, authors need not address items in this particular order in their reports. Rather, what is important is that the information for each item is given somewhere within the report. The PRISMA Checklist Title and Abstract Item 1: Title Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. Examples Recurrence rates of video-assisted thoracoscopic versus open surgery in the prevention of recurrent pneumothoraces: a systematic review of randomised and non-randomised trials (20). Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis (21). Explanation Authors should identify their report as a systematic review or meta-analysis. Terms such as review or overview do not describe for readers whether the review was systematic or whether a meta-analysis was performed. A recent survey found that 50% of 300 authors did not mention the terms systematic review or meta-analysis in the title or abstract of their systematic review (3). Although sensitive search strategies have been developed to identify systematic reviews (22), inclusion of the terms systematic review or meta-analysis in the title may improve indexing and identification. We advise authors to use informative titles that make key information easily accessible to readers. Ideally, a title reflecting the PICOS approach (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design) (see Item 11 and Box 2) may help readers as it provides key information about the scope of the review. Specifying the design(s) of the studies included, as shown in the examples, may also help some readers and those searching databases. Box 2. Helping To Develop the Research Question(s): The PICOS Approach. Some journals recommend indicative titles that indicate the topic matter of the review, while others require declarative titles that give the review's main conclusion. Busy practitioners may prefer to see the conclusion of the review in the title, but declarative titles can oversimplify or exaggerate findings. Thus, many journals and methodologists prefer indicative titles as used in the examples above. Item 2: Structured Summary Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; funding for the systematic review; and systematic review registration number.

Such is the case with the term “supply chain management”—so many definitions are used that there is little consensus on what it means. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the existing research in an effort to understand the concept of “supply chain management.” Various definitions of SCM and “supply chain” are reviewed, categorized, and synthesized. Definitions of supporting constructs of SCM and a framework are then offered to establish a consistent means to conceptualize SCM. Antecedents and consequences of SCM are identified, and the boundaries of SCM in terms of business functions and organizations are proposed. A conceptual model and unified definition of SCM are then presented that indicate the nature, antecedents, and consequences of the phenomena.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3c5d8952d509b86d06ece1c83244f148a1a4337,e3c5d8952d509b86d06ece1c83244f148a1a4337
"Schizophrenia: a concise overview of incidence, prevalence, and mortality.","J. Mcgrath, S. Saha, D. Chant, J. Welham","Recent systematic reviews have encouraged the psychiatric research community to reevaluate the contours of schizophrenia epidemiology. This paper provides a concise overview of three related systematic reviews on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality associated with schizophrenia. The reviews shared key methodological features regarding search strategies, analysis of the distribution of the frequency estimates, and exploration of the influence of key variables (sex, migrant status, urbanicity, secular trend, economic status, and latitude). Contrary to previous interpretations, the incidence of schizophrenia shows prominent variation between sites. The median incidence of schizophrenia was 15.2/100,000 persons, and the central 80% of estimates varied over a fivefold range (7.7-43.0/100,000). The rate ratio for males:females was 1.4:1. Prevalence estimates also show prominent variation. The median lifetime morbid risk for schizophrenia was 7.2/1,000 persons. On the basis of the standardized mortality ratio, people with schizophrenia have a two- to threefold increased risk of dying (median standardized mortality ratio = 2.6 for all-cause mortality), and this differential gap in mortality has increased over recent decades. Compared with native-born individuals, migrants have an increased incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. Exposures related to urbanicity, economic status, and latitude are also associated with various frequency measures. In conclusion, the epidemiology of schizophrenia is characterized by prominent variability and gradients that can help guide future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76ef8b1739dce5b548a12d9a7d8a686f6f5eaeb6,76ef8b1739dce5b548a12d9a7d8a686f6f5eaeb6
Monetary Policy Shocks: What Have We Learned and to What End?,"Lawrence J. Christiano, M. Eichenbaum, C.

We argue that this question is interesting because it lies at the center of a particular approach to assessing the empirical plausibility of structural economic models that can be used to think about systematic changes in monetary policy institutions and rules. The literature has not yet converged on a particular set of assumptions for identifying the effects of an exogenous shock to monetary policy. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement about the qualitative effects of a monetary policy shock in the sense that inference is robust across a large subset of the identification schemes that have been considered in the literature. We document the nature of this agreement as it pertains to key economic aggregates.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1052510051b91239c9004f7d79468369db4aa6a8,1052510051b91239c9004f7d79468369db4aa6a8

Adoption of Agricultural Innovations in Developing Countries: A Survey,"Gershon Feder, R. Just, D. Zilberman","This paper reviews various studies which have provided a description and possible explanation to patterns of innovation adoption in the agricultural sector. The survey points out that the tendency of many studies to consider innovation adoption in dichotomous terms (adoption/nonadoption) may not be appropriate in many cases where the actual decisions are defined over a more continuous range. More attention needs to be given to the socio-cultural and institutional environment in area studies so that their interrelation with economic factors affecting adoption can be inferred. The presence of several interrelated innovations is another aspect that needs to be considered more carefully in future research, since a number of simultaneous decisions may be involved. Furthermore, the possibility of regular sequential patterns in adopting components of a new technological package should be specifically addressed in future studies. Finally, the impact of differential adoption rates on land holding distribution merits attention in future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f23b66902a0562b60310c76ecd884f53159bb79f,f23b66902a0562b60310c76ecd884f53159bb79f

Towards a dynamic theory of strategy,M. Porter,"This paper reviews the progress of the strategy field towards developing a truly dynamic theory of strategy. It separates the theory of strategy into the causes of superior performance at a given period in time (termed the cross-sectional problem) and the dynamic process by which competitive positions are created (termed the longitudinal problem). The cross-sectional problem is logically prior to a consideration of dynamics, and better understood. The paper then reviews three promising streams of research that address the longitudinal problem. These still fall short of exposing the true origins of competitive success. One important category of these origins, the local environment in which a firm is based, is described.

A Framework for Immersive Virtual Environments (FIVE): Speculations on the Role of Presence in Virtual Environments,"M. Slater, S. Wilbur","This paper reviews the concepts of immersion and presence in virtual environments (VEs). We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments.

Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis.,L. Smircich,"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the International Communication Association/Speech Communication Association Conference on Interpretive Approaches to Organizational Communication, Alta, Utah, July 1981, and the Eastern Academy of Management meetings, Baltimore, Maryland, May 1982. I would like to express special appreciation to Mike Pacanowsky and Linda Putnam for organizing the Interpretive Conference, which provided the impetus as well as encouragement for the development of these ideas. Thanks also to Gareth Morgan, Linda Pike, Lou Pondy, and Karl Weick for their various forms of inspiration. This paper examines the significance of the concept of culture for organizational analysis. The intersection of culturetheory and organization theory is evident in five current research themes: comparative management, corporate culture, organizational cognition, organizational symbolism, and unconscious processes and organization. Researchers pursue these themes for different purposes and their work is based on different assumptions about the nature of culture and organization. The task of evaluating the power and limitations of the concept of culture must be conducted within this assumptive context.

Opinion spam and analysis,"Nitin Jindal, B. Liu","Evaluative texts on the Web have become a valuable source of opinions on products, services, events, individuals, etc. Recently, many researchers have studied such opinion sources as product reviews, forum posts, and blogs. However, existing research has been focused on classification and summarization of opinions using natural language processing and data mining techniques. An important issue that has been neglected so far is opinion spam or trustworthiness of online opinions. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of product reviews, which are opinion rich and are widely used by consumers and product manufacturers. In the past two years, several startup companies also appeared which aggregate opinions from product reviews. It is thus high time to study spam in reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study on this topic, although Web spam and email spam have been investigated extensively. We will see that opinion spam is quite different from Web spam and email spam, and thus requires different detection techniques. Based on the analysis of 5.8 million reviews and 2.14 million reviewers from amazon.com, we show that opinion spam in reviews is widespread.

This paper traces the history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades, including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) and the Sensor Information Technology (SensIT) programs. Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security, habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical challenges in sensor network development include network discovery, control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing, tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using local agents.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7533b973c457b96e81801eb94f9b001bd5d308c,e7533b973c457b96e81801eb94f9b001bd5d308c
Principles of experience-dependent neural plasticity: implications for rehabilitation after brain damage.,"J. Kleim, T. Jones","PURPOSE
This paper reviews 10 principles of experience-dependent neural plasticity and considerations in applying them to the damaged brain.


METHOD
Neuroscience research using a variety of models of learning, neurological disease, and trauma are reviewed from the perspective of basic neuroscientists but in a manner intended to be useful for the development of more effective clinical rehabilitation interventions.


RESULTS
Neural plasticity is believed to be the basis for both learning in the intact brain and relearning in the damaged brain that occurs through physical rehabilitation. Neuroscience research has made significant advances in understanding experience-dependent neural plasticity, and these findings are beginning to be integrated with research on the degenerative and regenerative effects of brain damage. The qualities and constraints of experience-dependent neural plasticity are likely to be of major relevance to rehabilitation efforts in humans with brain damage. However, some research topics need much more attention in order to enhance the translation of this area of neuroscience to clinical research and practice.


CONCLUSION
The growing understanding of the nature of brain plasticity raises optimism that this knowledge can be capitalized upon to improve rehabilitation efforts and to optimize functional outcome.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a73f093add8e85bd974bb729ff231ff4f925b8bd,a73f093add8e85bd974bb729ff231ff4f925b8bd
The Contribution of Action Research to Development in Social Endeavours: a position paper on action research methodology,B. Somekh,"In this invited paper, presented at the 1994 BERA conference, the author reviews key ideas arising from her own practice of action research and that of close colleagues over the past fifteen years, in particular John Elliott. The paper is divided into two parts. The first describes and comments upon the main characteristics of action research as perceived by this group; the second deals in rather more depth with a range of methodological and epistemological issues related to its practice. The latter include: the role of action research in teacher education and curriculum development; the context‐sensitive nature of action research and the resulting variations in its methodology in professional settings such as nursing, the police and commercial companies; the role of self in action research; the nature of practitioner knowledge; action research and writing; and action research and the structure‐agency debate.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e5a3b6cc7a965f452ee12dbea878b1b24ed2150b,e5a3b6cc7a965f452ee12dbea878b1b24ed2150b
Mining and summarizing customer reviews,"Minqing Hu, Bing Liu","Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992,cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992

Macropores and water flow in soils,"K. Beven, P. Germann","This paper reviews the importance of large continuous openings (macropores) on water flow in soils. The presence of macropores may lead to spatial concentrations of water flow through unsaturated soil that will not be described well by a Darcy approach to flow through porous media. This has important implications for the rapid movement of solutes and pollutants through soils. Difficulties in defining what constitutes a macropore and the limitations of current nomenclature are reviewed. The influence of macropores on infiltration and subsurface storm flow is discussed on the basis of both experimental evidence and theoretical studies. The limitations of models that treat macropores and matrix porosity as separate flow domains is stressed. Little-understood areas are discussed as promising lines for future research. In particular, there is a need for a coherent theory of flow through structured soils that would make the macropore domain concept redundant.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd2599bfca43ca735635b1d7acd901f164dd7462,dd2599bfca43ca735635b1d7acd901f164dd7462
The Relation between Price Changes and Trading Volume: A Survey,Jonathan M. Karpoff,"Abstract This paper reviews previous and current research on the relation between price changes and trading volume in financial markets, and makes four contributions. First, two empirical relations are established: volume is positively related to the magnitude of the price change and, in equity markets, to the price change per se. Second, previous theoretical research on the price-volume relation is summarized and critiqued, and major insights are emphasized. Third, a simple model of the price-volume relation is proposed that is consistent with several seemingly unrelated or contradictory observations.

Research Paper: The Use of Electronic Medical Records: Communication Patterns in Outpatient Encounters,"G. Makoul, R. Curry, P. Tang","OBJECTIVE
To assess physician-patient communication patterns associated with use of an electronic medical record (EMR) system in an outpatient setting and provide an empirical foundation for larger studies.


DESIGN
An exploratory, observational study involving analysis of videotaped physician-patient encounters, questionnaires, and medical-record reviews.


SETTING
General internal medicine practice at an academic medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Three physicians who used an EMR system (EMR physicians) and three who used solely a paper record (control physicians). A total of 204 patient visits were included in the analysis (mean, 34 for each physician).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Content analysis of whether physicians accomplished communication tasks during encounters; qualitative analysis of how EMR physicians used the EMR and how control physicians used the paper chart.


RESULTS
Compared with the control physicians, EMR physicians adopted a more active role in clarifying information, encouraging questions, and ensuring completeness at the end of a visit. A trend suggested that EMR physicians might be less active than control physicians in three somewhat more patient-centered areas (outlining the patient's agenda, exploring psychosocial/ emotional issues, discussing how health problems affect a patient's life). Physicians in both groups tended to direct their attention to the patient record during the initial portion of the encounter. The relatively fixed position of the computer limited the extent to which EMR physicians could physically orient themselves toward the patient. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the EMR and control physicians in terms of mean time across all visits, a difference did emerge for initial visits: Initial visits with EMR physicians took an average of 37.5 percent longer than those with control physicians.


SUMMARY
An EMR system may enhance the ability of physicians to complete information-intensive tasks but can make it more difficult to focus attention on other aspects of patient communication. Further study involving a controlled, pre-/post-intervention design is justified.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd00e3031676ccec141bb07ce889e7dc41e1d4ac,dd00e3031676ccec141bb07ce889e7dc41e1d4ac
Applying GRADE-CERQual to qualitative evidence synthesis findings: introduction to the series,"S. Lewin, Andrew Booth, C. Glenton, H. Munthe-Kaas, A. Rashidian, Megan Wainwright, Meghan A. Bohren, Ö. Tunçalp, C. Colvin, R. Garside, B. Carlsen, Etienne V. Langlois, J. Noyes","The GRADE-CERQual (‘Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research’) approach provides guidance for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from systematic reviews of qualitative research (or qualitative evidence syntheses). The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision-making, including guideline development and policy formulation. Confidence in the evidence from qualitative evidence syntheses is an assessment of the extent to which a review finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. CERQual provides a systematic and transparent framework for assessing confidence in individual review findings, based on consideration of four components: (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data, and (4) relevance. A fifth component, dissemination (or publication) bias, may also be important and is being explored. As with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach for effectiveness evidence, CERQual suggests summarising evidence in succinct, transparent, and informative Summary of Qualitative Findings tables. These tables are designed to communicate the review findings and the CERQual assessment of confidence in each finding. This article is the first of a seven-part series providing guidance on how to apply the CERQual approach. In this paper, we describe the rationale and conceptual basis for CERQual, the aims of the approach, how the approach was developed, and its main components. We also outline the purpose and structure of this series and discuss the growing role for qualitative evidence in decision-making. Papers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in this series discuss each CERQual component, including the rationale for including the component in the approach, how the component is conceptualised, and how it should be assessed. Paper 2 discusses how to make an overall assessment of confidence in a review finding and how to create a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. The series is intended primarily for those undertaking qualitative evidence syntheses or using their findings in decision-making processes but is also relevant to guideline development agencies, primary qualitative researchers, and implementation scientists and practitioners.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f097aecc7ec7bcc3fdd3107aebe0f2529b223654,f097aecc7ec7bcc3fdd3107aebe0f2529b223654
Conceptualizing inclusive research with people with intellectual disability.,"C. Bigby, P. Frawley, P. Ramcharan","BACKGROUND
The inclusion of people with intellectual disability in research is a common requirement of research funding. Little conceptual clarity is available to guide the conduct of inclusive research or judge its fidelity, there is minimal evidence of its impact, and questions remain about its feasibility and rigour.


METHOD
A comprehensive review of the peer reviewed literature and key texts was undertaken to more clearly conceptualize inclusive research and identify the issues associated with ways of approaching it.


FINDING
Three approaches to inclusive research were identified: advisory, leading and controlling, and collaborative group. Using the literature and the authors' own experience, each approach is illustrated and discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
A clearer conceptual framework is developed to guide researchers and administrators as they consider inclusive research and its feasibility to particular research questions. A strong self-advocacy movement is identified as one of the conditions necessary for inclusive research to flourish.


BACKGROUND
Organisations including government that fund research about people with an intellectual disability in the UK and Australia say it is important that people with an intellectual disability are involved in planning and doing research that is about them; this is called inclusive research. Some people have written about what they have done but not enough has been written and shared about the different ways of doing inclusive research.


METHOD
The people who wrote this paper looked at all the literature about ways of doing inclusive research and reflected on the way they had worked with a group of self advocates in writing about their history.


RESULTS
There are three main ways of doing inclusive research; (i) Where people with an intellectual disability give advice about what to do; (ii) Where people with an intellectual disability lead and control research (iii) Where people with and without intellectual disability work together as a group with different jobs based on their different interests and skills.


CONCLUSIONS
In the past there has been an idea that there is only one way to do inclusive research. This paper talks about the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of doing inclusive research, and when you might choose one way rather than another.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76e4d1be0dda43d39b9bec6a47445cd587f33728,76e4d1be0dda43d39b9bec6a47445cd587f33728

Interactive Informed Consent: Randomized Comparison with Paper Consents,"M. Rowbotham, J. Astin, K. Greene, S. Cummings","Informed consent is the cornerstone of human research subject protection. Many subjects sign consent documents without understanding the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights. Proof of comprehension is not required and rarely obtained. Understanding might improve by using an interactive system with multiple options for hearing, viewing and reading about the study and the consent form at the subject’s own pace with testing and immediate feedback. This prospective randomized study compared the IRB-approved paper ICF for an actual clinical research study with an interactive presentation of the same study and its associated consent form using an iPad device in two populations: clinical research professionals, and patients drawn from a variety of outpatient practice settings. Of the 90 participants, 69 completed the online test and survey questions the day after the session (maximum 36 hours post-session). Among research professionals (n = 14), there was a trend (p  = .07) in the direction of iPad subjects testing better on the online test (mean correct  =  77%) compared with paper subjects (mean correct  =  57%). Among patients (n = 55), iPad subjects had significantly higher test scores than standard paper consent subjects (mean correct  =  75% vs 58%, p < .001). For all subjects, the total time spent reviewing the paper consent was 13.2 minutes, significantly less than the average of 22.7 minutes total on the three components to be reviewed using the iPad (introductory video, consent form, interactive quiz). Overall satisfaction and overall enjoyment slightly favored the interactive iPad presentation. This study demonstrates that combining an introductory video, standard consent language, and an interactive quiz on a tablet-based system improves comprehension of research study procedures and risks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5aa5a0a7c274fa8c5c6603f2ecac5a300c88672,c5aa5a0a7c274fa8c5c6603f2ecac5a300c88672

Systematically reviewing qualitative and quantitative evidence to inform management and policy-making in the health field,"N. Mays, C. Pope, J. Popay","Policy-makers and managers have always used a wide range of sources of evidence in making decisions about policy and the organization of services. However, they are under increasing pressure to adopt a more systematic approach to the utilization of the complex evidence base. Decision-makers must address complicated questions about the nature and significance of the problem to be addressed; the nature of proposed interventions; their differential impact; cost-effectiveness; acceptability and so on. This means that Cochrane-style reviews alone are not sufficient. Rather, they require access to syntheses of high-quality evidence that include research and non-research sources, and both qualitative and quantitative research findings. There is no single, agreed framework for synthesizing such diverse forms of evidence and many of the approaches potentially applicable to such an endeavour were devised for either qualitative or quantitative synthesis and/or for analysing primary data. This paper describes the key stages in reviewing and synthesizing qualitative and quantitative evidence for decision-making and looks at various strategies that could offer a way forward. We identify four basic approaches: narrative (including traditional ‘literature reviews’ and more methodologically explicit approaches such as ‘thematic analysis’, ‘narrative synthesis’, ‘realist synthesis’ and ‘meta-narrative mapping’), qualitative (which convert all available evidence into qualitative form using techniques such as ‘meta-ethnography’ and ‘qualitative cross-case analysis’), quantitative (which convert all evidence into quantitative form using techniques such as‘quantitative case survey’ or ‘content analysis’) and Bayesian meta-analysis and decision analysis (which can convert qualitative evidence such as preferences about different outcomes into quantitative form or ‘weights’ to use in quantitative synthesis). The choice of approach will be contingent on the aim of the review and nature of the available evidence, and often more than one approach will be required.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9bf3669722857e812c66da3ed6262b6489b48892,9bf3669722857e812c66da3ed6262b6489b48892

Religiousness and mental health: a review.,"A. Moreira-Almeida, F. L. Neto, H. Koenig","OBJECTIVE
The relationship between religiosity and mental health has been a perennial source of controversy. This paper reviews the scientific evidence available for the relationship between religion and mental health.


METHOD
The authors present the main studies and conclusions of a larger systematic review of 850 studies on the religion-mental health relationship published during the 20th Century identified through several databases. The present paper also includes an update on the papers published since 2000, including researches performed in Brazil and a brief historical and methodological background.


DISCUSSION
The majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior, drug/alcohol use/abuse. Usually the positive impact of religious involvement on mental health is more robust among people under stressful circumstances (the elderly, and those with disability and medical illness). Theoretical pathways of the religiousness-mental health connection and clinical implications of these findings are also discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
There is evidence that religious involvement is usually associated with better mental health.

It is argued that this approach gives the ESL instructor insight into research writing processes and products, increases instructor confidence, provides accessible content, and produces texts from the literatures that can be used directly in class .The discussion reviews present knowledge of the research paper; considers the issues of genre, schema, and rhetorical structure; and relates the orientation taken in this article to the current debate about “process” and “product” approaches to ESL writing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82f82303f529dc1ef8dafa00ecc5dfe5ab7a562b,82f82303f529dc1ef8dafa00ecc5dfe5ab7a562b
Using the Internet for Surveys and Health Research,"G. Eysenbach, J. Wyatt","This paper concerns the use of the Internet in the research process, from identifying research issues through qualitative research, through using the Web for surveys and clinical trials, to pre-publishing and publishing research results. Material published on the Internet may be a valuable resource for researchers desiring to understand people and the social and cultural contexts within which they live outside of experimental settings, with due emphasis on the interpretations, experiences, and views of `real world' people. Reviews of information posted by consumers on the Internet may help to identify health beliefs, common topics, motives, information, and emotional needs of patients, and point to areas where research is needed. The Internet can further be used for survey research. Internet-based surveys may be conducted by means of interactive interviews or by questionnaires designed for self-completion. Electronic one-to-one interviews can be conducted via e-mail or using chat rooms. Questionnaires can be administered by e-mail (e.g. using mailing lists), by posting to newsgroups, and on the Web using fill-in forms. In ""open"" web-based surveys, selection bias occurs due to the non-representative nature of the Internet population, and (more importantly) through self-selection of participants, i.e. the non-representative nature of respondents, also called the `volunteer effect'. A synopsis of important techniques and tips for implementing Web-based surveys is given. Ethical issues involved in any type of online research are discussed. Internet addresses for finding methods and protocols are provided. The Web is also being used to assist in the identification and conduction of clinical trials. For example, the web can be used by researchers doing a systematic review who are looking for unpublished trials. Finally, the web is used for two distinct types of electronic publication. Type 1 publication is unrefereed publication of protocols or work in progress (a `post-publication' peer review process may take place), whereas Type 2 publication is peer-reviewed and will ordinarily take place in online journals.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6daf4207b99e6c3756748e99924a133365225c6,d6daf4207b99e6c3756748e99924a133365225c6

While this negativity effect is well documented at the product level, there is less consensus on whether negative or positive reviews are perceived to be more helpful by consumers. A limited number of studies document a higher perceived helpfulness for negative reviews under certain conditions, but accumulating empirical evidence suggest the opposite. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we propose that consumers can form initial beliefs about a product on the basis of the product’s summary rating statistics (such as the average and dispersion of the product’s ratings), and that these initial beliefs play a vital role in their subsequent evaluation of individual reviews. Using a unique panel data set collected from Apple’s App Store, we empirically demonstrate confirmation bias – that consumers have a tendency to perceive reviews that confirm (vs. dis-confirm) their initial beliefs as more helpful, and that this tendency is moderated by their confidence in their initial beliefs. Further, we show that confirmation bias can lead to greater perceived helpfulness for positive reviews (positivity effect) when the average product rating is high, and for negative reviews (negativity effect) when the average product rating is low. Thus, the mixed findings in the literature can be a consequence of confirmation bias. This paper is among the first to incorporate the important role of consumers’ initial beliefs and confidence in such beliefs (a fundamental dimension of metacognition) into their evaluation of online reviews, and our findings have significant implications for researchers, retailers and review websites.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8505f0cd41dda5cf50752ca85761ce860e9145a,c8505f0cd41dda5cf50752ca85761ce860e9145a
Retrospective reports of strategic‐level managers: Guidelines for increasing their accuracy,"G. Huber, D. Power","Strategic management studies frequently involve obtaining retrospective data from strategic-level managers. The use of this data acquisition methodology has received relatively little codification and little critical review or comment. This seems unfortunate, as discussion and codification of the methodology could be useful for those academic researchers and corporate staff who study strategic decisions and organizational processes and for those managers who may be asked to provide the retrospective data. This paper is an attempt to remedy the current state of affairs. In particular, the paper reviews several sources of the data inaccuracies that commonly affect retrospective data and offers guidelines for reducing the occurrence or magnitude of these inaccuracies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa900dee703102e02cfaa1d368f63d3c32aee510,aa900dee703102e02cfaa1d368f63d3c32aee510

Centering Decisions in Hierarchical Linear Models: Implications for Research in Organizations,"D. Hofmann, M. Gavin","Organizational researchers are increasingly interested in model ing the multilevel nature of organizational data. Although most organi zational researchers have chosen to investigate these models using traditional Ordinary Least Squares approaches, hierarchical linear models (i.e., random coefficient models) recently have been receiving increased attention. One of the key questions in using hierarchical linear models is how a researcher chooses to scale the Level-1 indepen dent variables (e.g., raw metric, grand mean centering, group mean centering), because it directly influences the interpretation of both the level-1 and level-2 parameters. Several scaling options are reviewed and discussed in light of four paradigms of multilevellcross-level research in organizational science: incremental (i.e., group variables add incremental prediction to individual level outcomes over and above individual level predictors), mediational (i.e., the influence of group level variables on individual outcomes are mediated by individual perceptions), moderational (i.e., the relationship between two individ ual level variables is moderated by a group level variable), and sepa rate (i.e., separate within group and between group models). The paper concludes with modeling recommendations for each of these paradigms and discusses the importance of matching the paradigm under which one is operating to the appropriate modeling strategy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89f6af2ba264d25169f10d225eae7e191f31a394,89f6af2ba264d25169f10d225eae7e191f31a394
Recommended Steps for Thematic Synthesis in Software Engineering,"D. Cruzes, T. Dybå","Thematic analysis is an approach that is often used for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data in primary qualitative research. 'Thematic synthesis' draws on the principles of thematic analysis and identifies the recurring themes or issues from multiple studies, interprets and explains these themes, and draws conclusions in systematic reviews. This paper conceptualizes the thematic synthesis approach in software engineering as a scientific inquiry involving five steps that parallel those of primary research. The process and outcome associated with each step are described and illustrated with examples from systematic reviews in software engineering.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab2ec1a1b6fdb710b2782554086a4782d50fc2c8,ab2ec1a1b6fdb710b2782554086a4782d50fc2c8

Biopolymer Coatings on Paper Packaging Materials.,"K. Khwaldia, E. Arab-Tehrany, S. Desobry","  Increased environmental concerns over the use of certain synthetic packaging and coatings in combination with consumer demands for both higher quality and longer shelf life have led to increased interest in alternative packaging materials research. Naturally renewable biopolymers can be used as barrier coatings on paper packaging materials. These biopolymer coatings may retard unwanted moisture transfer in food products, are good oxygen and oil barriers, are biodegradable, and have potential to replace current synthetic paper and paperboard coatings. Incorporation of antimicrobial agents in coatings to produce active paper packaging materials provides an attractive option for protecting food from microorganism development and spread. The barrier, mechanical, and other properties of biopolymer-coated paper are reviewed. Existing and potential applications for bioactive coatings on paper packaging materials are discussed with examples.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3e661dc53e73fd464a655a03147b9dea3baa26e,e3e661dc53e73fd464a655a03147b9dea3baa26e
Stiffness at small strain: research and practice,C. Clayton,"This paper provides the background to the 50th Rankine Lecture. It considers the growth in emphasis of the prediction of ground displacements during design in the past two decades of the 20th century, as a result of the lessons learnt from field observations. The historical development of the theory of elasticity is then described, as are the constitutive frameworks within which it has been proposed that geotechnical predictions of deformation should be carried out. Factors affecting the stiffness of soils and weak rocks are reviewed, and the results of a numerical experiment, assessing the impact of a number of stiffness parameters on the displacements around a retaining structure, are described. Some field and laboratory methods of obtaining stiffness parameters are considered and critically discussed, and the paper concludes with a suggested strategy for the measurement and integration of stiffness data, and the developments necessary to improve the existing state of the art.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dce3192082e7991f4c44dd573b89ac7140bc0c8,0dce3192082e7991f4c44dd573b89ac7140bc0c8
The flawed four‐level evaluation model,Elwood F. Holton,"The lack of research to develop further a theory of evaluation is aglaring shortcoming for human resource development (HRD). In this paper, 1 argue that the four-level system of training evaluation is really a taxonomy of outcomes and is flawed as an evaluation model Research is needed to develop a fully specified and researchable evaluation model. Such a model needs to specify outcomes correctly, account for the effects of intervening variables that affect outcomes, and indicate causal relationships. I propose a new model based on existing research and accounts for the impact of the primary intervening variables such as motivation to learn, trainability, job attitudes, personal characteristics, and transfer of training conditions. A new role for participant reactions is specified. Key studies supporting the model are reviewed and a research agenda proposed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a2101afd8b4e48c6755233f21311cedb932cd476,a2101afd8b4e48c6755233f21311cedb932cd476

UNDERWATER GLIDERS FOR OCEAN RESEARCH,"D. Rudnick, R. Davis, C. Eriksen, David M. Fratantoni, M. Perry","Underwater gliders are autonomous vehicles that profile vertically by buoyancy control and move horizontally on wings. Gliders are reviewed, from their conception by Stommel as an extension of autonomous profiling floats, through their development in 3 models, and including their first deployments singly and in numbers. This paper discusses the basics of glider function as implemented by University of Washington, Seaglider, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Webb Research in Slocum. Preliminary results are presented from a recent demonstration project that used a network of gliders off Monterey. A wide range of sensors has already been deployed on gliders, with many under development, and a wider range of future possibilities. Glider networks appear to be among the best approaches to achieving subsurface spatial resolution necessary for ocean research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cc5490a6616cd2be3de71f9ff7e96183bfdfd58,8cc5490a6616cd2be3de71f9ff7e96183bfdfd58
The role of national culture in international marketing research,J. Steenkamp,"Reviews and discusses the role of national culture in international marketing research. Special emphasis is given to national cultural frameworks. The two main national cultural frameworks – the Hofstede and the Schwartz – are discussed. Their interrelations are examined and four comprehensive national‐cultural dimensions are derived – autonomy versus collectivism, egalitarianism versus hierarchy, mastery versus nurturance, and uncertainty avoidance. The usefulness of national culture as an analytical basis in international marketing research is discussed and the construct of national culture is placed in the context of layers of culture, ranging from global cultures to micro cultures. Acculturation processes to other national cultures and antecedents of national culture are examined. The paper ends with concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3599fb8ce0677d5411ecd9bceab68cf05c191e83,3599fb8ce0677d5411ecd9bceab68cf05c191e83
Qualitative Research and the Academy of Management Journal,R. Gephart,"Editor's note: For this issue's ""From the Editors,"" I invited Robert Gephart of the University of Al-berta to reflect on his observations as a long-serving , award-winning reviewer of qualitative research for A!vII Over the past two and a half years, I have developed a tremendous respect for Bob's keen eye for evaluating qualitative research submissions , and great admiration for the painstaking advice he provides authors about how to improve their work. As a world-renowned qualitative author himself, Bob is in an excellent position to provide observations about how authors might increase the chances of having their qualitative research accepted for publication at AMI In a three-way electronic mail conversation about the challenges and opportunities of qualitative research , Bob, Tom Lee, and I all concluded that many authors with potentially very interesting data sets don't seem to know how to analyze them to their full potential. This is perhaps not surprising, gi ven the clear predominance of quantitative methods and statistics courses over qualitative ones, particularly in North America, as well as the inherently greater subjectivity involved in designing and analyzing qualitative research. As such, we encouraged Bob to provide a bit of a minitutorial-complete with reference citations and examples of high-quality papers that use particular qualitative approaches-in addition to his observations about qualitative research submitted to AMI The result is a longer-than-usual ""From the Edi-tors"" column. but one that we believe is well worth the extra reading time for anyone interested in producing , reviewing, or attempting to coax greater insights from qualitative research. We are fortunate to have someone with Bob's expertise share his observations, and we hope that his thoughts will prove useful to researchers for many years to come.

Sampling hard to reach populations.,"J. Faugier, Mary Sargeant","Studies on 'hidden populations', such as homeless people, prostitutes and drug addicts, raise a number of specific methodological questions usually absent from research involving known populations and less sensitive subjects. This paper examines the advantages and limitations of nonrandom methods of data collection such as snowball sampling. It reviews the currently available literature on sampling hard to reach populations and highlights the dearth of material currently available on this subject. The paper also assesses the potential for using these methods in nursing research.
